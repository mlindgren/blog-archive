While browsing [Reddit](http://reddit.com) today, I came across a short essay by
[Mordechai Ben-Ari](http://stwww.weizmann.ac.il/g-cs/benari/) titled
["Non-Myths About Programming"](/assets/p35-ben-ari.pdf) (PDF warning).
It's only six pages long, and I found it refreshingly realistic and insightful.
I would urge anyone considering a career in computer science to read it. Given
its brevity (and the fact the title is reasonably descriptive), I won't bother
summarizing the articleâ€”instead, I'll merely say that you should click the link
and check it out for yourself.
