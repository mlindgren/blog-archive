## What is Puzzle Panel?
Puzzle Panel is a match-three puzzle game I developed for the iPhone and iPod
Touch.  Its design is based on "puzzle league" style games. I have written a
[couple](/entry/2010/05/30/puzzle-panel-retrospective-part-i/)
[posts](/entry/2010/07/13/puzzle-panel-postmortem-the-good-framework/) about its
development.

## Where can I get it?
Puzzle Panel is currently unavailable. Please check back later.

## What about the source code?
The source code for Puzzle Panel is not currently available.  I would like to
make it available, but I haven't yet found the time to do a "proper" release,
which would entail a bit of cleaning, packaging and testing to ensure that it
would compile properly on other machines.  If you're interested in writing your
own iPhone game and are looking for a place to start, I recommend that you check
out [Cocos2D for iPhone](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/) and consider purchasing
the
[source code for Sapus Tongue](/entry/2010/07/13/puzzle-panel-postmortem-the-good-framework/),
a game developed by the author of Cocos2D. Your purchase will help support the
development of the premier 2D game development library for iOS.
