## What is Puzzle Panel?
Puzzle Panel is a match-three puzzle game, designed based on the popular "puzzle
league" gameplay style, which I developed for the iPhone and iPod
Touch in 2009.  Since its release on the iOS App Store in October of 2009, it
has been downloaded over 3,000 times worldwide. I have written a
couple posts ([1](/entry/2010/05/30/puzzle-panel-retrospective-part-i/),
[2](/entry/2010/07/13/puzzle-panel-postmortem-the-good-framework/)) about its
development.

## Where can I get it?
Puzzle Panel is currently available for **free**
[on the iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/puzzle-panel/id332677513).

## What about the source code?
The source code for Puzzle Panel is not currently available.  I would like to
make it available, but I haven't yet found the time to do a "proper" release,
which would entail a bit of cleaning, packaging and testing to ensure that it
would compile properly on other machines.  If you're interested in writing your
own iPhone game and are looking for a place to start, I recommend that you check
out [Cocos2D for iPhone](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/) and consider purchasing
the
[source code for Sapus Tongue](/entry/2010/07/13/puzzle-panel-postmortem-the-good-framework/),
a game developed by the author of Cocos2D. Your purchase will help support the
development of the premier 2D game development library for iOS.
