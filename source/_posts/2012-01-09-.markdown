Due to school and other commitments, I'm a bit behind the curve on writing about <em>Dark Souls</em>.  I purchased it when it was first released, but I was too busy to commit much time to it, and the release of <em>Skyrim</em> in November relegated it to the back burner.  I've recently had some more time to play it, and although I'm only about 32 hours in and perhaps half finished, I'm ready to make proclamation: <span style="background-color: #ff0;"><strong><em>Dark Souls</em> is the best game I've ever played,</strong> and to whatever extent art can be judged objectively, I think there's a strong argument to be made that it's objectively one of the best games ever created from an artistic standpoint.</span>

Whether or not you've played it, if you're a gamer you've likely heard of <em>Dark Souls</em>: besides the critical acclaim it has received, it's lauded as being <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/10/05/is-dark-souls-the-hardest-videogame-ever/" title="Is Dark Souls the hardest videogame ever?">arguably one of the most difficult games ever made</a>.  Its difficulty sets Dark Souls apart and makes successfully completing it a badge of merit among "hardcore" gamers.  More importantly, though, Dark Souls' relentless challenge and stubborn defiance of the precepts of modern game design allow it to achieve a level of artistic purity that other games can't even begin to approach.
