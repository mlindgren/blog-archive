I'm in the process of writing another book review, but as usual, it's turning
out to be longer than I expected. In the meantime, I'd like to direct all zero
of you who are just _dying_ to know my opinions on literature to
[this review](http://shayshortt.com/2014/12/02/in-real-life/) of Cory Doctorow
and Jen Wang's _In Real Life_, written by [my wife](http://shayshortt.com).
I'm not going to make a habit of linking to every one of her reviews (especially
given that she writes them far more frequently than I update this site), but
having also read _In Real Life_ (on her recommendation), I wholeheartedly agree
with her assessment and have little to add. Any comments should be directed to
her post.

My next review should be posted soon.
