  <div class="entry-content"><p>As the first book set in the Halo universe, Eric Nylund&rsquo;s <em>Halo: The Fall of
Reach</em> describes the training and induction of the first-ever Spartans,
including <a href="http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/John-117">John-117</a>, the Master Chief. It
follows the Spartans through some of their earliest missions, depicts humanity&rsquo;s
first contact with the <a href="http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Covenant_Empire">Covenant</a>,
and culminates in the battle for planet Reach, a human colony. I don&rsquo;t often
read fiction, and I am not sure I&rsquo;ve ever before read &ldquo;expanded universe&rdquo;
fiction for a game or a movie, so <em>Halo: The Fall of Reach</em> was a bit of an
unusual read for me. However, since I really enjoy the <em>Halo</em> games, universe,
and characters, and since this book came highly recommended by other fans of the
series, I figured it couldn&rsquo;t hurt to give it a try.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, per my <a href="/about/#review_policy">review policy</a>, I can&rsquo;t actually
review this book: the <em>Halo</em> series, and indeed the copyright to the book, is
owned by Microsoft, by whom I am employed by. Instead, I want to highlight a
few things that I found interesting in the book. <strong>Be warned that this post will
contain some spoilers for the book and other parts of the <em>Halo</em> series.</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I expect most people will already have some familiarity with Malala Yousafzai.
In case you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock, though, Malala is a young Pakistani
woman who, at the age of 15, was shot in the head by the Taliban for her
outspoken support of the right to education of children, including (especially)
girls, who are often denied the right due to their gender. Miraculously, she
survived the assassination attempt, and following her recovery, has continued to
campaign in support of education. Now, at age 17, she has an impressive list of
accomplishments and accolades to her name, including most recently becoming the
youngest Nobel laureate in history after jointly winning the 2014 Peace Prize
with Kailash Satyarthi, another activist for children&rsquo;s rights.</p>

<p><em>I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban</em>,
written jointly with award-winning foreign correspondent Christina Lamb, is
Malala&rsquo;s autobiography. It chronicles her experience growing up in Pakistan&rsquo;s
Swat Valley, the invasion of the Taliban into the area and her life under their
rule, their attempt on her life, and her recovery and continuing efforts in
support of education.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m in the process of writing another book review, but as usual, it&rsquo;s turning
out to be longer than I expected. In the meantime, I&rsquo;d like to direct all zero
of you who are just <em>dying</em> to know my opinions on literature to
<a href="http://shayshortt.com/2014/12/02/in-real-life/">this review</a> of Cory Doctorow
and Jen Wang&rsquo;s <em>In Real Life</em>, written by <a href="http://shayshortt.com">my wife</a>.
I&rsquo;m not going to make a habit of linking to every one of her reviews (especially
given that she writes them far more frequently than I update this site), but
having also read <em>In Real Life</em> (on her recommendation), I wholeheartedly agree
with her assessment and have little to add. Any comments should be directed to
her post.</p>

<p>My next review should be posted soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Originally published as a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindle_single">&ldquo;Kindle single&rdquo;</a> in 2011, Sam
Harris&#8217; <em><a href="http://www.samharris.org/lying">Lying</a></em> was republished in a revised
and expanded format in 2013, but it remains more of an essay than a book. The
entirety of the book weighs in at 108 pages, but the main content takes up only
about a third of that. The remaining two thirds consist of a transcript of a
conversation between Harris and professor Ronald A. Howard, whom Harris credits
as the inspiration for the book, and an FAQ based on feedback received since the
original publication. These latter two parts make a worthwhile addendum to the
original essay, but they are by no means indispensable: the centerpiece here is
Harris&#8217; analysis of the act of lying and all the ways in which it can lead to
bad outcomes.</p>

<p>In <em>Lying</em>, Harris attempts to make the case that dishonesty is almost always
unethical, and that simply by being truthful, one can avoid &ldquo;endless forms of
suffering and embarrassment.&rdquo; This might seem like a fairly obvious statement,
but Harris explicitly includes (and, in fact, primarily focuses on) &ldquo;white
lies&rdquo;&mdash;those small lies we tell not for our own benefit, but, we think, to
spare others from hurt feelings or unpalatable truths. Though white lies are
often told by good people for what they believe to be are good reasons, Harris
argues that the cost of these lies, in the long term, outweighs their benefit:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sam Harris is a controversial figure, to say the least. Personally, I&rsquo;m a fan of
his work, but as one of the &ldquo;four horsemen&rdquo; of so-called New Atheism, he has
met with much ire since the publication of his first book. This comes not only
from religious adherents, but also from secular liberals, many of whom seem to
willfully (and sometimes maybe even <em>gleefully</em>) misinterpret him.  Although
<em><a href="http://www.samharris.org/free-will">Free Will</a>,</em> published in 2012, courts
less political controversy than Harris&#8217; other works, it too will raise the
eyebrows of some readers. In fact, earlier this year, it met with a prickly
reception from fellow &ldquo;horseman&rdquo; and philosophy professor Dan Dennett.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&rsquo;ve ever read OkCupid&rsquo;s popular <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/">OkTrends</a> blog,
you&rsquo;re already familiar with the work of Christian Rudder. As OkCupid&rsquo;s resident
mathematician and one of its founders, he has been writing for years about
statistical trends related to dating and attraction, leveraging OkCupid&rsquo;s
vast database of traits about, and interactions between, its millions and millions
of users. OkTrends produced numerous interesting and surprising results, and it
developed a significant following before going quiet for the better part of
three years beginning in 2011.</p>

<p>Now, Rudder is back with
<a href="http://dataclysm.org/"><em>Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One&rsquo;s Looking</em></a>,
which expands on OkTrends by drawing from a wider variety of sources (including
Facebook, Google, and Twitter, in addition to OkCupid and other dating sites)
and discussing a more diverse set of topics.  Organized into three themed
sections which focus on, respectively, unity, division, and individuality, the
book explores what data can tell us about gender, sexuality, race, identity,
community, and other sociopolitical questions.  The discussion is consistently
balanced and neutral, which is important when dealing with such potentially
charged subjects, but Rudder also manages to inject enough of his personality
and characteristic style to keep the book enjoyable throughout.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has been about a month and a half now since The Elder Scrolls Online was
released, and it&rsquo;s received
<a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-online">generally mixed reviews</a>.
Despite some undeniable technical issues and a handful of design flaws, it&rsquo;s a
great game and more than a bit underrated in my opinion; if you&rsquo;re a fan of The
Elder Scrolls <em>or</em> an MMO aficionado, you owe it to yourself to give ESO a try.
I&rsquo;ll explain why.</p>

<p>First, by way of qualifications, I should mention my history with the Elder
Scrolls series. I didn&rsquo;t play Arena or Daggerfall, so I haven&rsquo;t been following
the series since its inception, but Morrowind captured hundreds of hours worth
of my attention and made a huge impression on my taste in games&mdash;it was
unlike anything I&rsquo;d ever played at the time, and not even other Elder Scrolls
games have quite managed to recapture that magic for me.  Oblivion was, at
first, quite awe-inspiring, but once the captivating new graphics wore thin, it
ultimately seemed shallow and uninspired compared to Morrowind. Skyrim was a
return to form, with better and more varied environments, a more interesting
story, and improvements to game mechanics all around&mdash;in addition to, once
again, remarkable visuals. In short, I&rsquo;ve been an Elder Scrolls fan for more
than 12 years now, so although I don&rsquo;t go <em>all the way</em> back, I have a good
basis for comparison.</p>

<p>The Elder Scrolls Online came as a surprise, being announced less than a year
after Todd Howard indicated that
<a href="http://massively.joystiq.com/2011/08/31/bethesdas-todd-howard-not-interested-in-an-elder-scrolls-mmo/">Bethesda had no interest in an Elder Scrolls MMO</a>.
In fact, at that point ESO had been in development for four years, but Howard
may not have known and certainly would not have been at liberty to reveal that.
At any rate, my initial reaction was extreme skepticism; I doubted that the best
aspects of The Elder Scrolls could be preserved when introduced to the MMO
formula. As more details were revealed about the game&rsquo;s design and mechanics, I
grew more interested, but I after playing the beta I was again left with
lukewarm impressions. Still, something about it kept nagging at me, and I
couldn&rsquo;t stop watching Twitch streams of ESO as launch drew nearer. Eventually,
I decided to buy it just in time for early launch. Since then, I&rsquo;ve put in
nearly 150 hours, and that number would doubtless be much higher were it not for
the obligations of the real world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Five months ago, I <a href="/entry/2013/07/30/road-trip/">left off my last post</a> having
just left Canyonlands National Park, heading further south to visit Bryce Canyon
and Zion National Parks. I had booked a motel for the evening in Panguitch,
Utah, which is a three or four hour drive from Moab. The drive there was
uneventful, with relatively little in the way of scenery. I mostly followed the
interstate, until about an hour outside of Panguitch, where I exited onto state
route 89.</p>

<p>Route 89 winds through scrub desert, farmland, and several very small towns
nestled between modest mountains. I arrived in Panguitch and discovered that it,
too, is very small. In contrast to Moab, though, it didn&rsquo;t seem to have much of
a tourist draw despite its proximity to Bryce Canyon. As a foreigner, I have to
admit that I felt some apprehension at this. Although everyone I&rsquo;d met in Utah
so far had been very friendly and welcoming, a small, isolated town like
Panguitch is the kind of place where I imagined that I could encounter a
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKcJ-0bAHB4">Top Gear-esque redneck mob</a>.
Granted, I wasn&rsquo;t driving around with a purposefully offensive slogan on my car,
nor do I really have a discernible accent, but I still felt like a pretty
obvious outsider with my Washington plates and conspicuous blue car with absurd
spoiler.  I was relieved, then, when I checked in at the New Western Motel and
was greeted at the front desk by an older Indian man (who I presume is also the
owner); it was good to see that the population of Panguitch isn&rsquo;t completely
homogeneous.</p>

<p>If you read the previous post you might recall that I had only slept for a few
hours the previous night, as I was up around 3:30am to get pictures of Delicate
Arch at night. That being the case, I was exhausted by the time I checked into
my room, so I decided to nap for a few hours before heading to Bryce Canyon. It
might have just been because I was so tired, but I distinctly recall thinking
that the bed in my motel room was among the most comfortable I had ever slept
in.</p>

<p>I woke up around five or six in the evening and went to grab dinner from &ldquo;The
Pizza Place&rdquo; in the nearby town of Tropic. Yes, it&rsquo;s literally just called &ldquo;The
Pizza Place.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a nice little family-run business, and the pizza was pretty
good. I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that they had several copies of the Book of
Mormon available for guests to peruse. That didn&rsquo;t surprise me, given that I was
in Utah, but I did find it strange that most if not all of the books seemed to
be written in Danish.</p>

<p>I made it to the Bryce Amphitheater in Bryce Canyon National Park just in time
for sunset, and took the opportunity to walk the Rim Trail and take some
pictures. Unfortunately, as it was quickly becoming dark, I didn&rsquo;t have time to
go on any of the hiking trails or explore the rest of the park. I contemplated
spending another day in Panguitch and going on a horseback tour of Bryce Canyon,
but ultimately opted to leave for Zion National Park the next morning so that
I&rsquo;d have more time there.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love visiting new places. I&rsquo;ve lived in the United States for just over a year
now, and one of my favourite things about this country is how vast it is and how
many opportunities it presents for exploration. Canada is just slightly larger
than the United States, but it&rsquo;s also very sparsely populated north of, say,
Edmonton, so practically speaking I think one can explore much more of the
States while still maintaining access to the comforts of civilization.</p>

<p>To that end, I try to go on at least one long road trip every year. I&rsquo;m also one
of those people who actually enjoy driving, even for absurdly long stretches of
time; anything up to 12 hours per day on the road is fairly comfortable for me,
and even beyond that I don&rsquo;t find long trips all that tiring. I&rsquo;d much, much
rather drive 12 hours in my car than take a two hour plane trip.</p>

<p>My new car was also begging to be broken in on a long road trip. Although I had
a bit of a <a href="/entry/2013/06/09/the-subaru-saga/">rocky start with it</a>, all of the
issues have now been sorted out (or at least as sorted out as they&rsquo;ll ever be),
so it offered another compelling reason to take a long trip. And so it was that
I booked the 5th to 12th of July off of work and embarked on a 3,378 mile
(5,436km) drive from Redmond, Washington through Oregon, Idaho, and Nevada to
Utah, and then back home through Arizona, Nevada, California and Oregon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Or &ldquo;buying used cars is the worst and I will never do it ever again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I recently purchased a new-to-me 2011
<a href="http://www.subaru.com/vehicles/impreza-wrx/index.html">Subaru WRX STI</a> sedan.
I had been thinking about buying a new car for a long time&mdash;since I
graduated, more or less. Until I bought my Subaru, I owned an ageing Honda Civic
(1997, to be precise).  While it was a very capable and extremely reliable car
throughout the many years I owned it for, it was old enough that it lacked some
of the conveniences one expects in a car these days, such as power locks and
windows, and most importantly, air conditioning.  The lack of air conditioning
in particular made it  less than ideal for summer road trips, and more
importantly, it was in need of some moderately expensive maintenance, and it
didn&rsquo;t seem to make sense to me to spend much money on it given that the overall
value of the car was fairly low.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t go on many test drives before I purchased my Subaru, but I didn&rsquo;t feel
the need to; I had already spent months watching reviews, reading forums,
comparing specs and window shopping on AutoTrader. I knew I wanted a sporty car
with plenty of horsepower for under $40,000, and all-wheel drive was a must as I
go to the mountains nearly every weekend in the winter and almost as often in
the summer. Besides the STI, the Evo, MazdaSpeed3, and the Golf R were the best
contenders, but each had significant drawbacks with regard to my personal
preferences. The Evo has a notoriously lacklustre interior (not that the STI is
<em>a lot</em> better, to be fair); I don&rsquo;t like the way the MazdaSpeed3 looks, and the
Golf comes with the reputation of higher maintenance costs for German cars.</p>

<p>I also really like the Subaru community.
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/subaru">/r/subaru</a> is the largest manufacturer-specific
subreddit, and in addition to forums like <a href="http://forums.nasioc.com/">NASIOC</a>,
it comprises a vibrant community of enthusiastic Subaru owners. Of course other
brands have significant followings as well&mdash;particularly VW&mdash;but my
impression of the Subaru community is that it&rsquo;s less elitist and, in contrast to
the others, puts as much emphasis on what one can <em>do</em> with the cars as on the
cars themselves. To &ldquo;go Subaruing&rdquo; is a popular term for going out into the mud
or the snow or the sand or the bush and getting the car wet and dirty, and
having a ton of fun in the process.</p>

<p>The STI, then, was the clear winner in my eyes.  Truth be told, a WRX probably
would have been more than sufficient for my needs, but I generally prefer to put
down the extra money and be sure that I&rsquo;m getting the best product. And hey, one
only has so long to exercise the opportunity to be young and irresponsible!</p>
