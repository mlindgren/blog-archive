It feels like a bit of a cop out to post this after having not written anything for five months, but I've decided to switch from shared hosting to a <acronym title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</a>.  I've also moved WordPress out of the www root directory.  The transition was surprisingly easy, but it's possible that some pages may contain dead links or missing images.  If you see any, please leave a comment and let me know!
