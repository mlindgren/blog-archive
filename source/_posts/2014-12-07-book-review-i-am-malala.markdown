I expect most people will already have some familiarity with Malala Yousafzai.
In case you've been living under a rock, though, Malala is a young Pakistani
woman who, at the age of 15, was shot in the head by the Taliban for her
outspoken support of the right to education of women and girls. Miraculously,
she survived the assassination attempt, and following her recovery, has
continued to campaign in support of education. Now, at age 17, she has an
impressive list of accomplishments and accolades to her name, including most
recently becoming the youngest Nobel laureate in history after jointly winning
the 2014 Peace Prize with Kailash Satyarthi, another activist for children's
rights.

_I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban_,
written jointly with award-winning foreign correspondent Christina Lamb, is
Malala's autobiography. It chronicles her experience growing up in Pakistan's
Swat Valley, the invasion of the Taliban into the area and her life under their
rule, their attempt on her life, and her recovery and continuing efforts in
support of education.<!-- more -->

Before I continue, a caveat about this review: reviews always contain elements
of subjectivity, and there's nothing wrong with that per se: art, after all, is
in the eye of the beholder. But a reviewer must endeavor to keep his own biases
in check, and in particular, to separate his opinion of the creator from his
judgment of the creation. In that respect, this review is difficult to write. I
believe that Malala Yousafzai is the most courageous and heroic person alive
today, and that her campaign has the potential to be among the most important
activist movements of the 21st century. The emancipation and education of
oppressed, powerless and impoverished women and girls in developing countries is
vitally important to global stability and progress, and Malala has become not
only an internationally-recognized figurehead for this struggle, but also,
through [her foundation](http://www.malala.org/) and her speeches, one of the
most important leaders in effecting a solution.

Naturally, then, I find I have a hard time criticizing Malala's work, and you
should bear that in mind as you read this review. Despite any effort to the
contrary, I will likely be more forgiving to this book than I would to a book
written by someone for whom I did not have such great respect.

It is unfortunate, then, that I must admit that this book took me almost a year
to read, and not due to its length: even including a short glossary and
timeline, it's barely more than 300 pages. The problem was that I just didn't
find the first third of the book very interesting, so I started reading it very
slowly, and then eventually put it down for a long time, only returning to it
recently.

The first chapters of _I Am Malala_ mainly serve as context for the rest
of the book. Malala first describes the history of Pakistan and of her family.
Her father is shown even before her birth to be an ambitious and courageous
person in his own right: as a young college graduate, he quickly progressed from
teaching English in a private college to setting up his own school, and
tenaciously oversaw its development into a sizeable and successful institution
despite many setbacks including considerable financial hardship and a natural
disaster which all but destroyed the school building.

Malala also describes her father's respect for women, which no doubt played a
formative role in her iron-willed personality, and which she contrasts with the
rest of [Pashtun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtun_people) culture:

> For most Pashtuns it's a gloomy day when a daughter is born. My father's
> cousin Jehan Sher Khan Yosafzai was one of the few who came to celebrate my
> birth and even gave a handsome gift of money. Yet, he brought with him a vast
> family tree of our clan, the Dalokhel Yousafzai, going right back to my
> great-great-grandfather and showing only the male line. My father, Ziauddin,
> is different from most Pashtun men. He took the tree, drew a line like a
> lollipop from his name and at the end of it he wrote, "Malala." His cousin
> laughed in astonishment. My father didn't care.

Finally, she describes her upbringing in Mingora, discussing everything from
broad details such as the nature of life in Swat (which will probably seem to
most western readers to be a peculiar mix of semi-modern technology,
infrastructure of varying quality, and ancient cultural traditions), to her
reputation in school as a talented and dedicated student. All of this is
necessary background, particularly for westerns such as myself who haven't the
slightest clue what life in Pakistan is like. Thus, I don't fault Yousafzai and
Lamb for including it in the book&mdash;but, well, it's just not very
interesting to read. Perhaps it's the linear, matter-of-fact way in which it's
written, or perhaps it's the marked similarity of Malala's life before the
Taliban occupation to that of a typical schoolchild, but I simply didn't find
this section very engaging. And yet, peculiarly, this section also seems to be
short on some basic factual details; for instance, until I looked it up for this
review, I had pictured Mingora (based on the books's description as much as my
own ignorance) as a small, rural city. In fact, though, its population was
175,000 in 1998&mdash;sixteen years ago, so it's likely grown considerably since
then. The city _I_ grew up in has less than half that population today. Thus, my
perception as I read the book was clearly skewed, in this respect.

The pace of the book picks up as the Talibanization of the Swat Valley begins in
2007, when Malala is ten years old. It started with a radio station run by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fazlullah_(militant_leader)">Maulana
Fuzlullah</a>, now a highly ranked militant leader in the Pakistani Taliban
(though as-yet unconfirmed reports indicate that he
[may have been killed](http://www.oneindia.com/international/ttp-chief-fazlullah-killed-pakistan-media-peshawar-siege-1598251.html)
in an airstrike <span style="background-color: yellow;">only four days
ago</span> as of this writing). Fazlullah's broadcasts started innocently
enough:

> He used his station to encourage people to adopt good habits and abandon
> practices he said were bad. He said men should keep their beards but give up
> smoking and using the tobacco they liked to chew. He said people should
> stop using heroin, and _chars_, which is our word for hashish.

Over time, though, Fazlullah became increasingly radical and fundamentalist,
claiming that sinful actions such as "listening to music, watching movies and
dancing" had caused a recent earthquake, instructing women to never leave their
homes except in emergencies, and to always be veiled while in public, and
referring to the Pakistani government as infidels, stating that "his men would
'enforce [Sharia law] and tear [government officials] to pieces." On the 12th of
July 2007, following the
[Red Mosque siege](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Lal_Masjid), Fazlullah
declared war on the Pakistani government.

The Taliban continued to spread throughout the Swat valley. By 2009, the
Talibanization had become so widespread that even local politicians, including
the area's deputy commissioner, were involved: "When the highest authority in
your district joins the Taliban, then Talibanization becomes normal." As they
gained more and more political power, they also began enforcing their strict
interpretation of Islamic doctrine through threats and outright violence. They
issued an edict banning the education of girls, and meted out brutal punishments
for "immoral" acts such as dancing or wearing clothes in correctly. There were
bombings, executions, and public whippings.

It was during this time that Yousafzai began writing, at the behest of the BBC,
"a diary about life under the Taliban." This diary was
[published online](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7834402.stm) as part of
the BBC's coverage of the situation in Swat, but Malala used the pseudonym "Gul
Makai" due to the great danger inherent in criticizing the Taliban. This only
lasted until a few months, though. The Pakistani militarty had been trying,
noncommittally and mostly ineffectively, to push back the the Taliban, but after
a brief ceasefire, in May of 2009 the military launched a full-scale operation,
"Operation True Path, to drive the Taliban out of Swat." This resulted in an
exodus of civilians from the valley, and thus Malala and her family became
"Internally Displaced Persons," forced to leave their home for nearly three
months while the army effected its campaign to take back Swat. But, of course,
the end of the military campaign in Swat in July of 2009 did not truly mean that
the valley was free of Taliban.

> In Swat we began to see more signs that the Taliban had never really left. Two
> more schools were blown up and three foreign aid workers from a Christian
> group were kidnapped as they returned to their base in Mingora and then
> murdered. We received other shocking news. My father's friend Dr. Mohammad
> Farooq, the vice chancellor of Swat University, had been killed by two gunmen
> who burst into his office. Dr. Farooq was an Islamic scholar and former member
> of the Jamaat-e-Islami party, and as one of the biggest voices against
> Talibanization he had even issued a fatwa against suicide attacks.

> Once again people started worrying that the Taliban were creeping back. But

> Taliban."

Despite this, Malala continued speaking at events in support of education and
peace, and continued to gain national and international attention, including
winning Pakistan's National Peace Prize&mdash;a brand new award for which Malala
was the first recipient ever. But, of course, this stubborn refusal to be
silenced would come at great cost to Malala.

On Tuesday, October 9th, 2012, Malala was shot in the head by
<span style="background-color: yellow;">a young Taliban gunman</span>
as she rode the school bus home. This chapter, in contrast to the terrible event
it describes, is probably the best written in the book. Malala describes
every minute detail of the moments leading up to the assassination attempt: the
sounds from the shops along the road, the smell of the air, and then the sudden,
ominous absence of people in the street. Even though this is the part of
Malala's story that everyone already knows, it's pulse-quickening to read in her
own words, and at this point the book becomes very hard to put down.

The rest of the book, which comprises about a fifth of its total length,
describes Malala's treatment and recovery, and briefly illustrates her new life
in Birmingham, England. Living in England has given Malala the opportunity to
return to school, and to continue to speak out in support of education for
children, without being in constant danger. Nevertheless, she misses her home in
Swat, and already has aspirations to return to Pakistan:

> I know I will go back to Pakistan, but whenever I tell my father I want to go
> home, he finds excuses. "No, [dear one], your treatment is not complete," he says,
> or, "These schools are good. You should stay here and gather knowledge so you
> can use your words powerfully."
>
> He is right. I want to learn and be trained well with the weapon of knowledge.
> Then I will be able to fight more effectively for my cause.

Here again, though, I wish _I Am Malala_ provided more detail. Malala's cause is
clear, as is her fearless determination in pursuit of it. Still only seventeen
years old, she already has the support and recognition of the international
community, and a non-profit foundation in her name working towards her dream of
safe, free education for all children. But achieving this will be no easy task,
and I wish the book provided a more complete picture of Malala's vision. Besides
the overt threat of terrorist groups such as the Taliban, Malala and her
foundation will have to contend with poverty, war, cultural impediments to
learning, suspicion of the west and its influence, and myriad other
<span style="background-color: yellow;">
[forces of Moloch](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/).
</span>. She has a long fight ahead of her. What is her plan?

Perhaps this is a lot to expect from a seventeen-year-old. But then, Malala has
very clearly demonstrated that she is no ordinary seventeen-year-old. I'm sure
she has given some thought to these issues, and I wish her book had provided
more insight in that respect. For instance, she brielfy mentions
[a now-infamous letter](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/17/the-taliban-s-letter-to-malalayousafzai.html)
she received from Taliban commander Adnan Rashid, who claims she was shot for
espousing what the Taliban view as a pro-Western, anti-Islamic ideology. She
barely dedicates a paragraph in response to this, but even here in the west
there are people who take Rashid's words at face value, as if he has a
legitimate stance on the matter. This is a problem that Malala will likely
have to contend with for as long as she continues to fight for her cause. I can
only hope that details such as these will be the subject of another book.

Much as I'd like to, I can't say that _I Am Malala_ is among the best books I've
ever read. It is linear and factual to a fault, some of it written almost like a
narrated <acronym title="curriculum vitae">CV</acronym>, and is at times
ponderously paced. It seems to me to be more about what Malala has _done_ than
who she _is_: for an autobiography, it seems curiously impersonal. That said,
the latter two-thirds of the book are still an enjoyable read, at least for
those who want to know Malala's story. Most importantly, whatever quibbles I
have with the way _I Am Malala_ is written, it may well be one of the most
_important_ books I've ever read, because like Malala herself, it is a testament
to what can be accomplished through hope, dedication, and perseverance.

I hope, and expect, that we will only hear more and more about Malala Yousafzai
as the years go on.
