<h2><span style="text-align: center;">What is Puzzle Panel?</span></h2>
<span style="text-align: center;">Puzzle Panel is a match-three Puzzle Game for the iPhone and iPod Touch.  Its design is based on "puzzle league" style games.  A trailer which demonstrates basic gameplay is available <a title="Puzzle Panel Trailer" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obg-I9JnzFU">here.</a></span>
<h2><span style="text-align: center;">Where can I get it?</span></h2>
<span style="text-align: center;">Unfortunately, you can't for the time being.  Because I'm currently unwilling to pay Apple's $100 developer program fee, Puzzle Panel is no longer available on the iTunes App Store.  I would like to remedy this situation and make Puzzle Panel available again in some capacity, but I haven't yet decided when or how that might happen.</span>
<h2><span style="text-align: center;">What about the source code?</span></h2>
<span style="text-align: center;">The source code for Puzzle Panel is not currently available.  I would like to make it available, but I haven't yet found the time to do a "proper" release, which would entail a bit of cleaning, packaging and testing to ensure that it would compile properly on other machines.  If you're interested in writing your own iPhone game and are looking for a place to start, I recommend that you check out <a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/">Cocos2D for iPhone</a> and consider purchasing the <a href="http://www.sapusmedia.com/sources/">source code to Sapus Tongue.</a> Your purchase will help support the development of the premier 2D game development library for iOS.</span>
<h2><span style="text-align: center;">Anything else?</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">I occasionally write about Puzzle Panel and its development.  You can find Puzzle Panel-related posts <a href="http://www.mlindgren.ca/archives/tag/puzzle-panel">here.</a></span>
