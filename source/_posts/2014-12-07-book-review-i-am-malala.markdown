I expect most of you will be familiar with Malala Yousafzai, but if you're not,
she is a Pakistani education activist who, at the age of 15, was shot in the
head by the Taliban for her outspoken support for the education of women and
girls. Miraculously, she survived the assassination attempt, and following her
recovery, redoubled her campaign in support of education. Now, at age 17, she
has an impressive list of accomplishments and accolades to her name, including
most recently becoming the youngest Nobel laureate in history after jointly
winning the 2014 Peace Prize with Kailash Satyarthi, another activist for
children's rights.

_I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban_,
written jointly with award-winning foreign correspondent Christina Lamb, is
Yousafzai's autobiography. It chronicles her experience growing up in Pakistan's
Swat Valley, the invasion of the Taliban into the area and her life under their
rule, and their attempted assassination of her for outspoken support of the
right to education of all children, including girls.

Reviews always contain elements of subjectivity, and there's nothing wrong with
that per se: art, after all, is in the eye of the beholder. But a reviewer must
endeavor to keep his own biases in check, and in particular, to separate his
opinion of the creator from his judgment of the creation. In that respect, this
review is difficult for me to write. I think that Malala Yousafzai is the
bravest and most heroic person alive today, and potentially also one of the most
important people to the future of civilization. The emancipation and education
of oppressed, powerless and impoverished women and girls in developing countries
is vitally important to <span style="background-color: yellow;">global
progress</span>, and Malala has become not only a global symbol of this
struggle, but also, through [her foundation](http://www.malala.org/) and her
outreach, one of the foremost <span style="background-color:
yellow;">individuals</span> in effecting a solution.

Naturally, then, I find I have a hard time criticizing Malala's work, and you
should bear that in mind as you read this review. Try as I might to maintain
objectivity, I will likely be more forgiving to this book than I would to a book
written by someone for whom I did not have such great respect. It is a bit
troubling, then, that I have to admit that this book took me almost a year to
read, and not due to its length: even including a short glossary and timeline,
it's barely more than 300 pages. The problem was that I just didn't find the
first third of the book very interesting, so I started reading it very slowly,
and then eventually put it down for a long time, only returning to it recently.

The first chapters of _I Am Malala_ seem to mainly serve as context for the rest
of the book. Malala first describes the history of Pakistan and of her family.
Her father is shown even before her birth to be an ambitious and courageous
person in his own right: as a young college graduate, he quickly progressed from
teaching English in a private college to setting up his own school, and
tenaciously oversaw its development into a sizeable and successful institution
despite many setbacks including considerable financial hardship and a natural
disaster which all but destroyed the school building.

Malala also describes her father's respect for women, which no doubt played a
formative role in her iron-willed personality, and which she contrasts with the
rest of [Pashtun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtun_people) culture:

> For most Pashtuns it's a gloomy day when a daughter is born. My father's
> cousin Jehan Sher Khan Yosafzai was one of the few who came to celebrate my
> birth and even gave a handsome gift of money. Yet, he brought with him a vast
> family tree of our clan, the Dalokhel Yousafzai, going right back to my
> great-great-grandfather and showing only the male line. My father, Ziauddin,
> is different from most Pashtun men. He took the tree, drew a line like a
> lollipop from his name and at the end of it he wrote, "Malala." His cousin
> laughed in astonishment. My father didn't care.

Finally, she describes her upbringing in Mingora, discussing everything from
broad details such as the nature of life in Swat (which will probably seem to
most western readers to be a peculiar mix of semi-modern technology,
infrastructure of varying quality, and ancient cultural traditions), to her
reputation in school as a talented and dedicated student. All of this is
necessary background, particularly for westerns such as myself who haven't the
slightest clue what life in Pakistan is like. Thus, I don't fault Yousafzai and
Lamb for including it in the book&mdash;but, well, it's just not very
interesting to read. Perhaps it's the linear, matter-of-fact way in which it's
written, or perhaps it's the marked similarity of Malala's life before the
Taliban occupation to that of a typical schoolchild, but I simply didn't find
this section very engaging. And yet, peculiarly, this section also seems to be
short on some basic factual details; for instance, until I looked it up for this
review, I had pictured Mingora (based on the books's description as much as my
own ignorance) as a small, rural city. In fact, though, its population was
175,000 in 1998&mdash;sixteen years ago, so it's likely grown considerably since
then. The city _I_ grew up in has less than half that population today. Thus, my
perception as I read the book was clearly skewed, in this respect.

The pace of the book picks up as the Talibanization of the Swat Valley begins in
2007, when Malala is ten years old. It started with a radio station run by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fazlullah_(militant_leader)">Maulana
Fuzlullah</a>, now a highly ranked militant leader in the Pakistani Taliban
(though as-yet unconfirmed reports indicate that he
[may have been killed](http://www.oneindia.com/international/ttp-chief-fazlullah-killed-pakistan-media-peshawar-siege-1598251.html)
in an airstrike <span style="background-color: yellow;">only four days
ago</span> as of this writing). Fazlullah's broadcasts started innocently
enough:

> He used his station to encourage people to adopt good habits and abandon
> practices he said were bad. He said men should keep their beards but give up
> smoking and using the tobacco they liked to chew. He said people should
> stop using heroin, and _chars_, which is our word for hashish.

Over time, though, Fazlullah became increasingly radical and fundamentalist,
claiming that sinful actions such as "listening to music, watching movies and
dancing" had caused a recent earthquake, instructing women to never leave their
homes except in emergencies, and to always be veiled while in public, and
referring to the Pakistani government as infidels, stating that "his men would
'enforce [Sharia law] and tear [government officials] to pieces." On the 12th of
July 2007, following the
[Red Mosque siege](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Lal_Masjid), Fazlullah
declared war on the Pakistani government.

The Taliban continued to spread throughout the Swat valley. By 2009, the
Talibanization had become so widespread that even local politicians, including
the area's deputy commissioner, were involved: "When the highest authority in
your district joins the Taliban, then Talibanization becomes normal." As they
gained more and more political power, they also began enforcing their strict
interpretation of Islamic doctrine through threats and outright violence. They
issued an edict banning the education of girls, and meted out brutal punishments
for "immoral" acts such as dancing or wearing clothes in correctly. There were
bombings, executions, and public whippings.

It was during this time that Yousafzai began writing, at the behest of the BBC,
"a diary about life under the Taliban." This diary was
[published online](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7834402.stm) as part of
the BBC's coverage of the situation in Swat, but Malala used the pseudonym "Gul
Makai" due to the great danger inherent in criticizing the Taliban. This only
lasted until a few months, though. The Pakistani militarty had been trying,
noncommittally and mostly ineffectively, to push back the the Taliban, but after
a brief ceasefire, in May of 2009 the military launched a full-scale operation,
"Operation True Path, to drive the Taliban out of Swat." This resulted in an
exodus of civilians from the valley, and thus Malala and her family became
"Internally Displaced Persons," forced to leave their home for nearly three
months while the army effected its campaign to take back Swat. But, of course,
the end of the military campaign in Swat in July of 2009 did not truly mean that
the valley was free of Taliban.

> In Swat we began to see more signs that the Taliban had never really left. Two
> more schools were blown up and three foreign aid workers from a Christian
> group were kidnapped as they returned to their base in Mingora and then
> murdered. We received other shocking news. My father's friend Dr. Mohammad
> Farooq, the vice chancellor of Swat University, had been killed by two gunmen
> who burst into his office. Dr. Farooq was an Islamic scholar and former member
> of the Jamaat-e-Islami party, and as one of the biggest voices against
> Talibanization he had even issued a fatwa against suicide attacks.

and here we come to the
part of Malala's story that most readers will already be familiar with.
