I [left off](/entry/2013/07/30/road-trip/) (four months ago) having just left
Canyonlands National Park, heading further south to visit Bryce Canyon and Zion
National Parks. I had booked a motel for the evening in Panguitch, Utah, which
is a three or four hour drive from Moab. The drive there was uneventful,
with relatively little in the way of scenery. The route leaves the interstate
about an hour outside of Panguitch and follows route 89 through several very
small towns.

I arrived in Panguitch and discovered that it, too, is very small. In contrast
to Moab, though, it didn't seem to have much of a tourist draw despite its
proximity to Bryce Canyon. As a foreigner, I have to admit that I felt some
apprehension at this. Although everyone I'd met in Utah so far had been very
friendly and welcoming, a small, isolated town like Panguitch is the kind of
place where I imagined that something like
[this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKcJ-0bAHB4) might happen. Granted, I
wasn't driving around with a purposefully offensive slogan on my car, nor do I
really have a discernible accent, but I still felt like a pretty obvious
outsider with my Washington plates and conspicuous blue car and absurd spoiler.
I was relieved, then, when I arrived at the New Western Motel to check in to my
room and was greeted at the front desk by an older Indian man (who I presume is
also the owner); it was good to see that the population of Panguitch isn't
completely homogenous.

If you read the previous post you might recall that I had only slept for a few
hours the previous night, as I was up around 3:30am to get pictures of Delicate
Arch at night. That being the case, I was exhausted by the time I checked into
my room, so I decided to nap for a few hours before heading to Bryce Canyon. It
might have just been because I was so tired, but I distinctly recall thinking
that the bed in my motel room was among the most comfortable I had ever slept
in.

I woke up around five or six in the evening and went to grab dinner from "The
Pizza Place" in the nearby town of Tropic. Yes, it's literally just called "The
Pizza Place." It's a nice little family-run business, and the pizza was pretty
good. I couldn't help but notice that they had several copies of the Book of
Mormon available for guests to peruse. That didn't surprise me, given that I was
in Utah, but I did find it strange that most if not all of the books seemed to
be written in Danish.

I made it to the Bryce Amphitheater in Bryce Canyon National Park just in time
for sunset, and took the opportunity to walk the Rim Trail and take some
pictures. Unfortunately, as it was quickly becoming dark, I didn't have time to
go on any of the hiking trails or explore the rest of the park. I contemplated
spending another day in Panguitch and going on a horseback tour of Bryce Canyon,
but ultimately opted to leave for Zion National Park the next morning so that
I'd have more time there.<!-- more -->

The next morning I made the 70-mile drive to Zion National Park, and when I
arrived I immediately knew that I'd made the right choice in prioritizing it
over another day at Bryce Canyon. The descent into the canyon from the eastern
entrance is nothing short of spectacular. The Checkerboard Mesa is the first
sight to greet visitors entering from the east, and it alone is a pretty
remarkable formation, but it offers only the faintest hint at what awaits. Walls
of red stone rise up on either side as the road continues its descent into the
Zion-Mt. Carmel tunnel. The long, narrow tunnel was carved right into the side
of the canyon between during the years of 1927 to 1930. Ocassional openings in
the side of the tunnel offer glimpses of the valley below, but the sight when
one finally emerges on the other side is truly breathtaking. To me, it felt very
reminiscent of the descent into Yosemite valley, but with towering walls of red
sandstone instead of granite. As impressive as the drive is, though, it doesn't
even pass through Zion Canyon proper.

I checked into my campground, set up my tent, and formulated a plan to hike up
to
[Angels Landing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_Landing).
It was still early in the afternoon, and far too hot for a 5 mile (8km) hike
with around 1500 feet (460m) of elevation gain. Luckily, my campground was also
an RV park and inn, so it had amenities such as a pool and showers. I lounged
around the pool until later in the afternoon when the temperature started to
drop, and then, carrying my tripod, camera, and an ample supply of water, hopped
on the canyon bus.

Due to the limited area of the canyon, and to reduce environmental impact,
visitors aren't allowed to drive or park in Zion Canyon itself. Instead, the
park operates a free shuttle bus up and down the canyon, complete with narration
describing the history of the canyon and the significance of each of location it
stops at. While informative, the narration gets a bit tiring after the third or
fourth time you hear it, which makes one feel sorry for the park staff who are
subjected to it daily. On the first bus I took, a woman who I assumed to be an
off-duty park employee entertained us by reciting, word for word, several
minutes of the narration.

The climb up to Angels Landing starts off with a deceptively gentle walk along
the river at the bottom of the canyon, but then quickly climbs upward along a
series of increasingly steep switchbacks. It was still hot enough out to make
the upward trek thoroughly exhausting. Thankfully, the aptly named Refrigerator
Canyon offered some respite. Encountered about half way through the hike, the
small box canyon is consistently several degrees cooler than ambient
temperatures.

At the end of Refrigerator Canyon, the trail ascends
[Walter's Wiggles](http://www.zionnational-park.com/images/album2/pages/angels-landing-ef_jpg.htm),
a set long set of tight, steep switchbacks, and then emerges atop a spine of
cliff that culminates in Angels Landing itself. This is where the trail really
gets fun&mdash;or terrifying, depending on whom you ask. I don't consider myself
to be particularly afraid of heights, but the view down to the valley floor is
truly dizzying, even before one reaches the top of Angels Landing. And between
the the top of the of the Wiggles and the Landing, there are still hundreds of
vertical feet to climb along a twisting, rocky, extremely narrow trail where a
slip to either side means certain death. So steep is this section of trail that
much of it is spent pulling oneself upward along sections of chain that the
National Park Service has anchored into the rock. It's remarkable that
[only a handful of people have died at Angels Landing](http://www.nps.gov/zion/frequently-asked-questions-about-zions-hiking-trails.htm).
Did I mention that I was carrying a tripod and several pounds of camera
equipment the whole way up?

Arriving at the summit, though, the perilious hike proved to be more than
worthwhile as I was afforded a beautiful view of Zion Canyon. The brilliant
green foliage along the valley floor gives way to majestic orange cliffs, which
turn fiery red as the sun sinks in the distance. Words can't do it justice, and
frankly, neither can my photography.

Later that evening, I drove back along the Zion-Mount Carmel highway, stopping a
few miles from the east entrance to try to get a few pictures of the stars above
the canyon. That didn't work out as well as I had hoped, but I did see another
scorpion!

The next day, I set off to hike
[The Narrows](http://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/thenarrows.htm), a 16-mile
long, 20-30 foot wide, 2000 foot-deep gorge carved by the Virgin River. What
makes The Narrows unique is that there is no hiking trail at all: the hike
actually takes place _in the river_. As such, it can vary greatly in difficulty
depending on the season; during months where the water level is high, it can be
all but impassable, whereas in the summer it tends to be relatively easy with
water ranging from ankle-deep to waist-deep. Because I don't typically plan
ahead at all for my vacations, I hadn't planned ahead to visit The Narrows, per
se&mdash;in fact, I hadn't really been aware of their existence prior to my
arrival at the park. It was pure luck, then, that I ended up visiting Zion
during the summer when water levels were low.

Even when the water is low, such an atypical hike requires extra preparation, so
I walked across the road from my campground to the
[Zion Adventure Company](http://www.zionadventures.com/) and picked up the
required gear.  This consisted of a pair of canyoneering shoes and neoprene
socks, a walking stick, and a waterproof bag for my camera equipment. I ended up
finding the walking stick to be more of a burden than a boon, and the waterproof
bag wasn't really necessary either given the low water levels, but it's better
to be safe than sorry with expensive camera equipment.

A word of advice for anyone planning to hike The Narrows, though: if you rent
canyoneering shoes, make sure they fit _with plenty of room to spare._ They'll
shrink in the water, so shoes that are a comfortable fit at the beginning of the
day can become very, very uncomfortable after several hours in the river. I
learned this the hard way: by the end of my hike, I could barely walk, and much
of the toenail on my big toe on my left foot ended up turning black and falling
off. Four months later, it's finally _almost_ completely grown back.

Aside from that slightly painful mistake on my part, though, The Narrows proved
to be a truly amazing hike, unlike anything I've ever done before. Looking
thousands of feet up the sheer canyon wall offers a new perspective on the
enormity of Zion Canyon, and there's something new to see in every corner of the
canyon: foliage sprouting out of the ancient stone, birds circling overhead,
gurgling springs pouring from cracks in the walls, and all around, the
ever-changing Virgin River.

There are two ways to hike The Narrows. Starting from the top down, it's a
16-mile hike, which the National Park Service estimates will take about 12
hours. Unfortunately, this route requires two permits, one of which I gather is
very sought-after and therefore difficult to get. Not having either permit, I
was left with the bottom-up hike, which is a 10-mile round trip if you go all
the way to the mandatory turn-around point at Big Spring, which I did. I also
took the optional side-trip into Orderville Canyon, which added another mile to
the hike for a total of around 11 miles.
