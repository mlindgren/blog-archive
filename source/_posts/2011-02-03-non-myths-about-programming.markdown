Whilst browsing <a href="http://reddit.com" target="_blank">Reddit</a> today, I came across a short essay by <a href="http://stwww.weizmann.ac.il/g-cs/benari/" target="_blank">Mordechai Ben-Ari</a> titled "<a title="PDF: Non-Myths About Programming" href="http://stwww.weizmann.ac.il/G-CS/BENARI/articles/nonmyths.pdf" target="_blank">Non-Myths About Programming</a>" (PDF warning).  It's only six pages long, and I found it refreshingly realistic and insightful.  I would urge anyone considering a career in computer science to read it.  Given its brevity (and the fact the title is reasonably descriptive), I won't bother summarizing the article—instead, I'll merely say that you should click the link and check it out for yourself.
