<h2>What about the source code?</h2>
The source code for Puzzle Panel is not currently available.  I would like to make it available, but I haven't yet found the time to do a "proper" release, which would entail a bit of cleaning, packaging and testing to ensure that it would compile properly on other machines.  If you're interested in writing your own iPhone game and are looking for a place to start, I recommend that you check out <a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/">Cocos2D for iPhone</a> and consider purchasing the <a href="http://www.sapusmedia.com/sources/">source code to Sapus Tongue.</a> Your purchase will help support the development of the premier 2D game development library for iOS.
