Puzzle Panel is a match-three puzzle game, designed based on the popular "puzzle
league" gameplay style, which I developed for the iPhone and iPod
Touch in 2009. Since its release on the iOS App Store in October of 2009, it
has been downloaded over 3,000 times worldwide. I have written a
couple posts ([1](/entry/2010/05/30/puzzle-panel-retrospective-part-i/),
[2](/entry/2010/07/13/puzzle-panel-postmortem-the-good-framework/)) about its
development.

Here is a trailer featuring Puzzle Panel's gameplay:

## Where can I get it?
Unfortunately, Puzzle Panel is currently unavailable. Keeping it on the iOS App
Store requires paying a $99/year fee, which I have opted not to continue paying
for the time being. If you are really interested in acquiring a copy of Puzzle
Panel, leave a comment and I'll try to arrange something.

## What about the source code?
The source code for Puzzle Panel is not currently available. Regrettably, I
never had time to clean up and package the code for public release, and at this
point it is severely outdated; the framework it is based on has changed
considerably since it was written. Thus, it would be of little use to anyone, so
it's unlikely that I will ever release it. If you're interested in writing your
own iPhone game and are looking for a place to start, I recommend that you check
out [Cocos2D for iPhone](http://www.cocos2d-swift.org/) or
[Cocos2D-X](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/), a cross-platform version of the same
framework. (That said, there are _dozens_ of mobile game development frameworks
available now, so don't take my word for it. See what's available and pick
whatever looks best to you!)
