Via a friend's Facebook feed comes this
[excellent article](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2012/06/12/the-care-and-feeding-of-software-engineers-or-why-engineers-are-grumpy/)
about "the psychology of software engineers and what makes us the way we are."
I'm in almost complete agreement with the article, although I do somewhat take
issue with this paragraph:

> Part of the problem [of software engineers consistently giving overoptimistic
> estimates and then failing to meet them] is also our fragile egos. We get
> afraid that if we give an estimate that is "too long", that people will think
> less of us.  "Good engineers" should be able to work faster, they say, and so
> we acquiesce.

I don't really think software engineers in general have "fragile egos," or at
least not to a greater extent than people in any other profession. We _are_
notoriously bad at giving realistic estimates, but in my experience, this is
often because we're actually incentivized to do so: deadlines are set before the
amount of work required for a project is actually determined, or without regard
to it, and then we're made to fit our estimates into too-short iterations while
still trying to accomplish all we set out to do. There's a common sentiment that
it's better to be under-optimistic and out-perform your goals than the converse,
and while that seems true in theory, in practice there don't seem to be many
discouragements to failing to live up to estimates that everyone already knows
are unrealistic and often meaningless.

By contrast, I think the fear that people will think less of us for giving "too
long" estimates is completely valid in a culture where it's commonplace to set
unrealistic goals and then break our backs trying to achieve them by any means
necessary. I think this especially true at the feature team level when one is
working on a large piece of software. What do you expect to happen to a team
that estimates up front that its feature cannot be completed within the release
window? (Remember,
[adding more engineers might just make the problem worse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month).)
I think it's safe to say that it won't involve promotions and pay raises.

Finally, as my wife pointed out when we discussed this article, the
[planning fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy) is by no means
unique to software engineers.

All of that said, I think the rest of the article is very good; this part in
particular struck a chord for me (emphasis mine):

> So, without enough information, changing requirements, not enough knowledge to
