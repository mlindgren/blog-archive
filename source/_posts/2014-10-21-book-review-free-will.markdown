Sam Harris is a controversial figure, to say the least. Personally, I'm a fan of
his work, but as one of the "four horsemen" of so-called New Atheism, he has
met with much ire since the publication of his first book. This comes not only
from religious adherents, but also from secular liberals, many of whom seem to
willfully (and sometimes maybe even _gleefully_) misinterpret him.  Although
_[Free Will](http://www.samharris.org/free-will),_ published in 2012, courts
less political controversy than Harris' other works, it too will raise the
eyebrows of some readers. In fact, earlier this year, it met with a prickly
reception from fellow "horseman" and philosophy professor Dan Dennett.

In _Free Will_, Harris lays out a case against the philosophical concept of the
same name. There are many facets to his argument, but I think his primary claims
can be enumerated as follows:

1. Scientific research shows that "determinism, in every sense relevant to human
behavior, is true. Unconscious neural events determine our thoughts and
actions&mdash;and are themselves determined by prior causes of which we are
subjectively unaware."
1. [Determinism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/)
cannot be reconciled with (what Harris believes is) the popular conception of
free will. (In philosophical terms, this means that Harris takes an
_incompatibilist_ stance on the relationship between determinism and free will.
He spends much of the book arguing against
_[compatibilism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/)_, which is
a philosophy that tries to reconcile the concepts.)
1. Even if determinism were not true (due to, for example, randomness in quantum
events), free will would _still_ not be possible, as in that case "[our wills
would be] the product of chance and we [would not be] responsible for them."
1. Upon introspection, "free will doesn't even correspond to any _subjective_
fact about us ... Seeming acts of volition merely arise spontaneously (whether
caused, uncaused, or probabilistically inclined, it makes no difference) and
cannot be traced to a point of origin in our conscious minds."

Harris begins with the scientific evidence for the determined nature of human
behavior. He writes:

> The physiologist Benjamin Libet famously used EEG to show that activity in the
> brain's motor cortex can be detected some 300 milliseconds before a person
> feels that he has decided to move. Another lab extended this work using
> functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): Subjects were asked to press one
> of two buttons while watching a "clock" composed of a random sequence of
> letters appearing on a screen. They reported which letter was visible at the
> moment they decided to press one button or the other. The experimenters found
> two brain regions that contained information about which buttons subjects
> would press a full _7 to 10 seconds_ before the decision was consciously made.
> More recently, direct recordings from the cortex showed that the activity of
> merely 256 neurons was sufficient to predict with 80 percent accuracy a
> person's decision to move 700 milliseconds before he became aware of it.

(Harris provides sources for each of these claims in the book, but I am not
reproducing the citations here for the sake of brevity.) These findings are
pretty remarkable in their own right, and will probably be quite unsettling to
some readers. This is also likely the only part of the book that will seem truly
novel to those already highly schooled in philosophy; the debate about free will
has been ongoing for centuries, and it seems unlikely to me that Harris' short
book (at less than 100 pages long) contains any truly novel philosophical
arguments. Even so, I'm not sure the discussion of these studies will actually
work to Harris' advantage.  The core of his argument _is_ philosophical, but
some readers are certain to get caught up in overthinking the scientific claims,
even though, as Harris himself states, nothing actually depends on them.

In fact, Harris goes so far as to say that even if one believes that
consciousness originates in a "soul" which is separate from and unconstrained by
our physical brains, that _still_ would not make free will feasible: a soul
would not change the fact that we do not have full awareness of, let alone
control over, the origins of our thoughts and intentions. To use one of Harris'
examples:

> Why did I order beer instead of wine? Because I prefer beer. Why do I prefer
> it? I don't know, but I generally have no need to ask. Knowing that I like
> beer more than wine is all I need to know to function in a restaurant.
> Whatever the reason, I prefer one taste to the other. Is there freedom in
> this? None whatsoever. Would I magically reclaim my freedom if I decided to
> spite my preference and order wine instead? No, because the roots of this
> intention would be as obscure as the preference itself.

Even with that example, I suspect this claim is likely to confuse many readers,
as a naÃ¯ve reading of it will make it seem flatly absurd: you probably _can_
explain most of your thoughts and intentions with reference to your values,
preferences, duties, etc.  But Harris' point is that if you follow this chain of
causation back as far as possible, you will inevitably arrive at something you
either can't explain or have no control over. You might say that you prefer beer
over wine (or vice versa) because beer is more pleasing to your taste buds. But
_why_ is it more pleasing? Probably, ultimately, because of your genes.
Obviously, you have no hand in that. (I hope I'm not muddying the water by
adding that whatever you _think_ your reasons for a given decision are,
[studies have shown](http://www.texasenterprise.utexas.edu/article/do-you-make-buying-decisions-based-logic-or-emotion-tale-two-chickens)
that many of the decisions we make are actually rationalized after the fact.)

Neither does the possibility of indeterminism offer any refuge for free will,
claims Harris. I think he is being accurate when he states that arguing against
determinism is no longer "philosophically respectable," but nevertheless there
are some who persist in doing so. In fact, often as a way to salvage traditional
notions of free will, "some scientists and philosophers hope that chance or
quantum uncertainty can make room for [it]." This argument doesn't stand up to
much scrutiny, though, and Harris dispatches it succinctly, observing that
"[c]hance occurrences are by definition ones for which I can claim no
responsibility. And if certain of my behaviors are truly the result of chance,
they should be surprising _even to me_. How would neurological ambushes of this
kind make me free?"

Harris reserves a couple chapters at the end of the book to discuss the
practical consequences of giving up one's belief in free will. I found these
chapters somewhat perfunctory and unconvincing. In fairness, they are tangential
to the actual purpose of the book, but given how deeply the assumption of free
will is rooted in human psychology and society, I would have liked to see a more
thorough discussion here. Moreover, I think Harris could have made room for that
by eschewing some of his examples of how we _feel_ free but really aren't, many
of which are reducible to the same observations and therefore feel repetitive
despite the book's short length.

On the impact of disbelief in free will on our behavior, Harris writes:

> Many people worry that free will is a necessary illusion&mdash;and that
> without it we will fail to live creative and fulfilling lives. This concern
> isn't entirely unjustified. One study found that having subjects read an
> argument against the existence of free will made them more likely to cheat on
> a subsequent exam. Another found such subjects to be less helpful and more
> aggressive. It is surely conceivable that knowing (or emphasizing) certain
> truths about the human mind could have unfortunate psychological and/or
> cultural consequences. However, I'm not especially worried about degrading
> the morality of my readers by publishing this book.

(Again, Harris provides citations for the studies he references.) Harris goes on
to justify the last sentence with reference to his personal experience of losing
his sense of free will, stating that it has "[increased his] feelings of
compassion and forgiveness, and [diminished his] sense of entitlement to the
fruits of my own good luck." I suppose his experience shows that it is
_possible_ for losing one's belief in free will to have positive (or at least
neutral) psychological consequences, but given that research shows that this is
not the typical result, I don't think that a personal anecdote should be enough
to set us at ease. Of course, it should go without saying that this has no
bearing on the existence or non-existence of free will.

Harris' discussion of morality is a bit more satisfying. He observes that,
without a belief in free will, retributive justice becomes difficult if not
impossible to justify: "Once we recognize that even the most terrifying
predators are, in a very real sense, unlucky to be who they are, the logic of
hating (as opposed to fearing) them begins to unravel." This is eminently
compatible with modern liberal understandings of how justice should operate.
Happily, the logic behind rehabilitation, incarceration for the safety of
society, and punishment as a means of deterrence, remains intact: "It may seem
paradoxical to hold people responsible for what happens in their corner of the
universe, but once we break the spell of free will, we can do this precisely to
the degree that it is useful."

#### Compatibilism

Astute readers may have noticed that I mentioned that Harris argues against
comaptibilism, but that thus far I have neglected to actually address those
arguments. That is because Harris' incompatibilist position is both somewhat
complex, and certainly the most controversial part of _Free Will_, at least
among philosophers.  Indeed, it is Harris' dismissal of compatibilism that
compelled professional philosopher Dan Dennett to write a
[criticism](http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/reflections-on-free-will)
of the book that is, as Harris observed, "nearly as long as the book itself."
I'm going to refer to both Dennett's criticism and Harris'
[response to it](http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-marionettes-lament)
throughout this section, which is unorthodox for a review, but in this case I
think those works make an extremely valuable addendum to the book itself, as
they expose (to a greater degree than the book does) the core of the
disagreement between Dennett's compatibilism and Harris' incompatibilism. (Where
I quote Harris, it will be from the text of _Free Will_, unless otherwise
noted.)

"Consider what it would actually take to have free will," Harris writes. "You
would need to be aware of all the factors that determine your thoughts and
actions, and you would need to have complete control over those factors." Harris
takes this as, I think, basically axiomatic, but compatibilists disagree.
Dennett writes that "[s]uch 'perfect' freedom is, of course, an incoherent
idea," which is true, but I think this is actually Harris' point: this is the
free will that people _suppose_ they have, but when one thinks about the
implications of that belief, it is shown to be nonsensical.

Here we arrive at another disagreement between Dennett and Harris: Dennett
argues that Harris doesn't actually know what people in general think about free
will, and that "suitably expressed questionnaires might well prove him wrong."
In fact, he provides a
[study](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=E39CD0E070F0F373146843196443CF02?doi=10.1.1.364.2437)
which he purports does exactly that: polls conducted but _Nahmias et al._ appear
to show that people with no philosophical background actually do have
compatibilist notions of free will.

In his response to Dennett, Harris disputes the validity of this study, noting
that "Nahmias and his coauthors repeatedly worry that their experimental
subjects didn't really understand the implications of determinism&mdash;and on
my reading, they had good reason to be concerned. ... More than anything, this
research suggests that people find the idea of libertarian free will so
intuitively compelling that it is very difficult to get them to think clearly
about determinism." I have to say that I am in agreement with Harris here.
Having read the paper, it is not at all clear to me that _Nahmias et al_
accurately assessed their subjects' compatibilist or incompatibilist
beliefs. They write:

> Despite our efforts to induce participants to make their judgments based on a
> conditional acceptance of the scenario, it is likely that some did not do so,
> as evidenced by those who missed the manipulation check on the back of the
> surveys, which tested whether they recognized the deterministic nature of the
> scenario. Some of these participants may have even been expressing
> incompatibilist intuitions, e.g., by asserting that Jeremy acts of his own
> free will and then (mis)responding that the scenario therefore could _not_
> have been describing a fully deterministic situation.

I agree with Harris that this is a very valid concern, and I'm not convinced
that the "manipulation check" (which isn't described in much detail) would have
been sufficient to account for it. _Nahmias et al_ note that "many" participants
found the deterministic scenarios they used "implausible or impossible," and
that in one case, "almost all participants" believed the scenario was
impossible. While participants' stated reasons for this belief varied, it seems
entirely plausible to me, and perhaps even likely, that a significant number of
participants could not effectively reason about the situations being presented
because of strong attachments to beliefs that contradict the scenarios'
premises.

In any case, Dennett argues that even if people do in fact have a natural
tendency towards libertarian incompatibilism (i.e. they believe in free will but
do not believe that it is compatible with determinism, and, perhaps
consequently, disbelieve determinism), this might just show "that most people
are suffering from a sort of illusion that could be replaced by wisdom." He
seems to believe that the illusion in this "folk conception of free will" is
based on Cartesian dualism, and that the goal of compatibilism is to correct
replace this "nonsense" with something more "scientifically sound."

Dennett wonders why Harris objects to this project and suggests that Harris is
arguing for Cartesian dualism, but this is a misconstrual: Harris is simply
drawing a distinction between what we consciously experience and all of the
unconscious processes our brains are engaged in at every moment, of which we
have no (subjective) knowledge. This is an important distinction, because
Dennett's compatibilist view of free will is predicated on the fact that "we are
coterminous with everything that goes on inside our bodies, whether we are
conscious of it or not" (Harris' words).  But although this is true, our
subjective, conscious experiences _are_ actually only proxies for the underlying
neural states in our brains; one simply does not have conscious access to the
totality of his or her being. This is not simply a misconception that can be
corrected: it does seem to be, as Harris argues, a "psychological fact," and I
would argue that it is probably also a _biological_ fact. I am sure this is not
what Dennett hopes to replace with compatibilism, but I find myself confused
about the nature of the misunderstanding he feels he can correct.

I am reluctant to dismiss Dennett's arguments outright without first reading his
own books on the subject, but intuitively I find myself agreeing with Harris
that compatibilism seems like a cop out. I have spent quite some time trying to
get at the root of this intuitive feeling, and I've found it difficult to do so
even with reference to Harris' arguments, which makes me suspicious of its
validity. But I think this paragraph by Dennett at least gets _close_ to the
core of my skepticism about compatibilism:

> Contrast your competence at this moment [of deciding which card to play in
> bridge] with the "competence" of a robotic bridge-playing doll that always
> plays its highest card in the suit, no matter what the circumstances.  It
> wasn't free to choose the six, because it would play the ace whatever the
> circumstances were whereas if it occurred to you to play the six, you could do
> it, depending on the circumstances. Freedom involves the ability to have one's
> choices influenced by changes in the world that matter under the
> circumstances.  Not a perfect ability, but a reliable ability. If you are such
> a terrible bridge player that you can never see the virtue in ducking a trick,
> playing less than the highest card in your hand, then your free will at the
> bridge table is seriously abridged: you are missing the opportunities that
> make bridge an interesting game. If determinism is true, are these real
> opportunities?  Yes, as real as an opportunity could be: thanks to your
> perceptual apparatus, your memory, and the well-lit environment, you are
> caused/determined to evaluate the situation as one that calls for playing the
> six, and you play the six.

If we instead contrast a human chess player with a computer such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)">Deep Blue</a>,
we see that the latter has all of the faculties that Dennett claims give a
person free will: "perceptual apparatus," memory, etc. Granted, the human player
could purposefully make a bad move, or quit the game, which the computer is not
free to do given its programming. But its programming could easily be changed to
permit those options as well. The point is that the computer behaves in a
determined manner according to the combination of its algorithm and the inputs
to that algorithm. Dennett seems to admit that we humans do exactly the same, if
with a more complex algorithm and broader range of inputs, but claims that this
is freedom nevertheless. But this does not seem to me to be a meaningful use of
the word _freedom_, and I think Harris is correct that it is not the sort of
freedom that most people suppose they have.

#### Conclusion

Despite the length at which I've discussed _Free Will_, there is much that I did
not cover. If you found this discussion even moderately interesting, then you'll
certainly enjoy the book, and I do recommend reading both Dennett's criticism
and Harris' response to it as well. Philosophical concepts can be extremely
difficult to grapple with, and reading about them second-hand is rarely
beneficial to understanding.

I really enjoyed reading _Free Will_, and I found myself agreeing with pretty
much all of it, but I hesitate to call it _convincing_: I was already skeptical
of the idea of free will given our scientific understanding of determinism, so I
really didn't need much persuasion. For those who feel a deep sense of
attachment to the idea of free will, I am not sure Harris' arguments will be
sufficient to convince you otherwise.  As the debate between Dennett and Harris
demonstrates, the concept itself can be so nebulous as to make it difficult to
even discuss. This may also prove an obstacle for those who lack exposure to
philosophical reasoning, as the arguments can sometimes seem to devolve into
semantic disputes. Conversely, those with a _significant_ philosophical
background may find _Free Will_ uninteresting as they're likely to have read
similar arguments before. For everyone else, though, it comes highly
recommended: this is the rare sort of book that could really have a profound
impact on a person, and it can be read in a sitting, so there's really not much
to lose.

Well, except your sense of autonomy, I suppose.
