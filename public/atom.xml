out to be longer than I expected. In the meantime, I&rsquo;d like to direct all zero
of you who are just <em>dying</em> to know my opinions on literature to
<a href="http://shayshortt.com/2014/12/02/in-real-life/">this review</a> of Cory Doctorow
and Jen Wang&rsquo;s <em>In Real Life</em>, written by <a href="http://shayshortt.com">my wife</a>.
I&rsquo;m not going to make a habit of linking to every one of her reviews (especially
given that she writes them far more frequently than I update this site), but
having also read <em>In Real Life</em> (on her recommendation), I wholeheartedly agree
with her assessment and have little to add. Any comments should be directed to
her post.</p>

<p>My next review should be posted soon.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Originally published as a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindle_single">&ldquo;Kindle single&rdquo;</a> in 2011, Sam
Harris&#8217; <em><a href="http://www.samharris.org/lying">Lying</a></em> was republished in a revised
and expanded format in 2013, but it remains more of an essay than a book. The
entirety of the book weighs in at 108 pages, but the main content takes up only
about a third of that. The remaining two thirds consist of a transcript of a
conversation between Harris and professor Ronald A. Howard, whom Harris credits
as the inspiration for the book, and an FAQ based on feedback received since the
original publication. These latter two parts make a worthwhile addendum to the
original essay, but they are by no means indispensable: the centerpiece here is
Harris&#8217; analysis of the act of lying and all the ways in which it can lead to
bad outcomes.</p>

<p>In <em>Lying</em>, Harris attempts to make the case that dishonesty is almost always
unethical, and that simply by being truthful, one can avoid &ldquo;endless forms of
suffering and embarrassment.&rdquo; This might seem like a fairly obvious statement,
but Harris explicitly includes (and, in fact, primarily focuses on) &ldquo;white
lies&rdquo;&mdash;those small lies we tell not for our own benefit, but, we think, to
spare others from hurt feelings or unpalatable truths. Though white lies are
often told by good people for what they believe to be are good reasons, Harris
argues that the cost of these lies, in the long term, outweighs their benefit:</p>

</div>


<blockquote><p>What could be wrong with truly &ldquo;white&rdquo; lies? First, they are still lies. And
in telling them, we incur all the problems of being less than straightforward
in our dealings with other people. Sincerity, authenticity, integrity, mutual
understanding&mdash;these and other sources of moral wealth are destroyed the
moment we deliberately misrepresent our beliefs, whether or not our lies are
ever discovered.</p>

<p>And although we imagine that we tell certain lies out of compassion for
others, it is rarely difficult to spot the damage we do in the process. By
lying, we deny our friends access to reality&mdash;and their resulting
ignorance often harms them in ways we did not anticipate. Our friends may act
on our falsehoods, or fail to solve problems that could have been solved only
on the basis of good information. Rather often, to lie is to infringe on the
freedom of those we care about.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>When we presume to lie for the benefit of others, we have decided that <em>we</em>
are the best judges of how much they should understand about their own
lives&mdash;about how they appear, their reputation, or their prospects in the
world. This is an extraordinary stance to adopt toward other human beings, and
it requires justification. Unless someone is suicidal or otherwise on the
brink, deciding how much he should know about himself seems the quintessence
of arrogance. What attitude could be more disrespectful of those we care
about?</p></blockquote>

<p>Harris provides a number of examples of how white lies can backfire: by
dishonestly telling a friend that he doesn&rsquo;t need to lose weight, you might be
denying him the motivation he needs to live a healthier lifestyle. By hiding a
serious medical diagnosis from loved ones, you foreshorten their opportunity to
come to terms with it, and miss a chance to deepen your relationship. By
providing false encouragement about a friend&rsquo;s career prospects, you lead her to
waste time and energy that might be spent more productively with a change of
course.</p>

<p>Although he does make a case for honesty in situations in which many of us would
be tempted to lie, Harris does not seem to be advocating for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Honesty">&ldquo;Radical Honesty&rdquo;</a>. Radical
Honesty, <a href="http://www.esquire.com/features/honesty0707">as I understand it</a>,
requires not only complete honesty, but also complete <em>transparency</em>, and what
some might call a stunning lack of tact. Harris, by contrast, allows that it may
sometimes be necessary to &ldquo;[hold] one&rsquo;s tongue, or [steer] a conversation toward
topics of relative safety&rdquo; in order to maintain civility. He also sees no
conflict in principle between being honest and keeping secrets: &ldquo;If someone asks
how much money you have in your bank account, you are under no ethical
obligation to tell him. The truth could well be &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather not say.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harris&#8217; position is certainly easier to embrace than &ldquo;Radical Honesty,&rdquo; which I
imagine could easily ruin your life if you don&rsquo;t have <em>extremely</em> understanding
friends and family. That said, it&rsquo;s still not easy, in practice, to always be
honest. It is hard to tell people things that you know they won&rsquo;t want to hear.
It takes willpower and emotional energy to always make the virtuous choice
rather than looking for the easy way out. And there are edge cases, rare but by
no means impossible, where the ethical value of honesty really does seem
questionable. For instance, consider this example from Harris&#8217; conversation with
professor Howard:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Harris:</strong> &hellip; Other examples of this [ethical difficulty] have come to me from
people who are caring for parents with dementia. Your mother wakes up every
morning wondering where your father is, but your father has been dead for
fifteen years. Every time you explain this, your mother has to relive the
bereavement process all over again, only to wake up the next morning looking
for her husband. Let&rsquo;s assume that when you lie, saying something like &ldquo;Oh,
he&rsquo;s away on a business trip,&rdquo; your mother very quickly forgets about your
father&rsquo;s absence and her grief doesn&rsquo;t get reactivated.</p>

<p><strong>Howard:</strong> That&rsquo;s an interesting one. I would be tempted to say something like
&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s where he usually is at this time of day.&rdquo; The fact that he&rsquo;s
buried in the ground somewhere doesn&rsquo;t add anything to this person&rsquo;s knowledge
of what&rsquo;s going on. And as you pointed out, you would just be putting her
through pain all over again. As you stated the case, why would you want to do
that?</p></blockquote>

<p>This answer doesn&rsquo;t seem entirely satisfactory. First of all, what if you were
asked for a more specific answer than the one Howard gave? In that case, I think
you really would be forced to lie, and from a consequentialist point of view
that really does seem like the right thing to do given the situation; Howard
almost admits as much. And even if that&rsquo;s not the case, Howard&rsquo;s answer still
seems deliberately designed to be deceptive, even if it is not strictly false.
He goes on to call this &ldquo;&lsquo;skillful truth-telling&rsquo; as opposed to &lsquo;evasion,&rsquo;&rdquo; but
that seems like a euphemism to me.</p>

<p>This exemplifies the problem I have with <em>Lying</em>. I&rsquo;m in complete agreement with
Harris that lying is almost never the right choice, for both ethical and
practical reasons. But believing that in principle is much different from
adhering to it in practice. How does we resist the almost reflexive impulse to
tell people only what we think they want to hear? Where do we draw the line
between reasonably concealing of private information and dishonestly withholding
facts that people have a right to know? And how can we train ourselves to
reliably decide when situations really do warrant &ldquo;skillful truth-telling&rdquo; if
not outright deception? These questions are not always easy to answer, and I
don&rsquo;t think that <em>Lying</em> does enough to address them.</p>

<p>If you find yourself to really be in need of convincing that white lies can be
harmful and should generally not be ethically permissible, then <em>Lying</em> is
probably a worthwhile read. But if you already accept that proposition, this
book is hard to recommend.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sam Harris is a controversial figure, to say the least. Personally, I&rsquo;m a fan of
his work, but as one of the &ldquo;four horsemen&rdquo; of so-called New Atheism, he has
met with much ire since the publication of his first book. This comes not only
from religious adherents, but also from secular liberals, many of whom seem to
willfully (and sometimes maybe even <em>gleefully</em>) misinterpret him.  Although
<em><a href="http://www.samharris.org/free-will">Free Will</a>,</em> published in 2012, courts
less political controversy than Harris&#8217; other works, it too will raise the
eyebrows of some readers. In fact, earlier this year, it met with a prickly
reception from fellow &ldquo;horseman&rdquo; and philosophy professor Dan Dennett.</p>

</a>
</div>


<p>In <em>Free Will</em>, Harris lays out a case against the philosophical concept of the
same name. There are many facets to his argument, but I think his primary claims
can be enumerated as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Scientific research shows that &ldquo;determinism, in every sense relevant to human
behavior, is true. Unconscious neural events determine our thoughts and
actions&mdash;and are themselves determined by prior causes of which we are
subjectively unaware.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/">Determinism</a>
cannot be reconciled with (what Harris believes is) the popular conception of
free will. (In philosophical terms, this means that Harris takes an
<em>incompatibilist</em> stance on the relationship between determinism and free will.
He spends much of the book arguing against
<em><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/">compatibilism</a></em>, which is
a philosophy that tries to reconcile the concepts.)</li>
<li>Even if determinism were not true (due to, for example, randomness in quantum
events), free will would <em>still</em> not be possible, as in that case &ldquo;[our wills
would be] the product of chance and we [would not be] responsible for them.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Upon introspection, &ldquo;free will doesn&rsquo;t even correspond to any <em>subjective</em>
fact about us &hellip; Seeming acts of volition merely arise spontaneously (whether
caused, uncaused, or probabilistically inclined, it makes no difference) and
cannot be traced to a point of origin in our conscious minds.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>


<p>Harris begins with the scientific evidence for the determined nature of human
behavior. He writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>The physiologist Benjamin Libet famously used EEG to show that activity in the
brain&rsquo;s motor cortex can be detected some 300 milliseconds before a person
feels that he has decided to move. Another lab extended this work using
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): Subjects were asked to press one
of two buttons while watching a &ldquo;clock&rdquo; composed of a random sequence of
letters appearing on a screen. They reported which letter was visible at the
moment they decided to press one button or the other. The experimenters found
two brain regions that contained information about which buttons subjects
would press a full <em>7 to 10 seconds</em> before the decision was consciously made.
More recently, direct recordings from the cortex showed that the activity of
merely 256 neurons was sufficient to predict with 80 percent accuracy a
person&rsquo;s decision to move 700 milliseconds before he became aware of it.</p></blockquote>

<p>(Harris provides sources for each of these claims in the book, but I am not
reproducing the citations here for the sake of brevity.) These findings are
pretty remarkable in their own right, and will probably be quite unsettling to
some readers. This is also likely the only part of the book that will seem truly
novel to those already highly schooled in philosophy; the debate about free will
has been ongoing for centuries, and it seems unlikely to me that Harris&#8217; short
book (at less than 100 pages long) contains any truly novel philosophical
arguments. Even so, I&rsquo;m not sure the discussion of these studies will actually
work to Harris&#8217; advantage.  The core of his argument <em>is</em> philosophical, but
some readers are certain to get caught up in overthinking the scientific claims,
even though, as Harris himself states, nothing actually depends on them.</p>

<p>In fact, Harris goes so far as to say that even if one believes that
consciousness originates in a &ldquo;soul&rdquo; which is separate from and unconstrained by
our physical brains, that <em>still</em> would not make free will feasible: a soul
would not change the fact that we do not have full awareness of, let alone
control over, the origins of our thoughts and intentions. To use one of Harris&#8217;
examples:</p>

<blockquote><p>Why did I order beer instead of wine? Because I prefer beer. Why do I prefer
it? I don&rsquo;t know, but I generally have no need to ask. Knowing that I like
beer more than wine is all I need to know to function in a restaurant.
Whatever the reason, I prefer one taste to the other. Is there freedom in
this? None whatsoever. Would I magically reclaim my freedom if I decided to
spite my preference and order wine instead? No, because the roots of this
intention would be as obscure as the preference itself.</p></blockquote>

<p>Even with that example, I suspect this claim is likely to confuse many readers,
as a naïve reading of it will make it seem flatly absurd: you probably <em>can</em>
explain most of your thoughts and intentions with reference to your values,
preferences, duties, etc.  But Harris&#8217; point is that if you follow this chain of
causation back as far as possible, you will inevitably arrive at something you
either can&rsquo;t explain or have no control over. You might say that you prefer beer
over wine (or vice versa) because beer is more pleasing to your taste buds. But
<em>why</em> is it more pleasing? Probably, ultimately, because of your genes.
Obviously, you have no hand in that. (I hope I&rsquo;m not muddying the water by
adding that whatever you <em>think</em> your reasons for a given decision are,
<a href="http://www.texasenterprise.utexas.edu/article/do-you-make-buying-decisions-based-logic-or-emotion-tale-two-chickens">studies have shown</a>
that many of the decisions we make are actually rationalized after the fact.)</p>

<p>Neither does the possibility of indeterminism offer any refuge for free will,
claims Harris. I think he is being accurate when he states that arguing against
determinism is no longer &ldquo;philosophically respectable,&rdquo; but nevertheless there
are some who persist in doing so. In fact, often as a way to salvage traditional
notions of free will, &ldquo;some scientists and philosophers hope that chance or
quantum uncertainty can make room for [it].&rdquo; This argument doesn&rsquo;t stand up to
much scrutiny, though, and Harris dispatches it succinctly, observing that
&ldquo;[c]hance occurrences are by definition ones for which I can claim no
responsibility. And if certain of my behaviors are truly the result of chance,
they should be surprising <em>even to me</em>. How would neurological ambushes of this
kind make me free?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harris reserves a couple chapters at the end of the book to discuss the
practical consequences of giving up one&rsquo;s belief in free will. I found these
chapters somewhat perfunctory and unconvincing. In fairness, they are tangential
to the actual purpose of the book, but given how deeply the assumption of free
will is rooted in human psychology and society, I would have liked to see a more
thorough discussion here. Moreover, I think Harris could have made room for that
by eschewing some of his examples of how we <em>feel</em> free but really aren&rsquo;t, many
of which are reducible to the same observations and therefore feel repetitive
despite the book&rsquo;s short length.</p>

<p>On the impact of disbelief in free will on our behavior, Harris writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many people worry that free will is a necessary illusion&mdash;and that
without it we will fail to live creative and fulfilling lives. This concern
isn&rsquo;t entirely unjustified. One study found that having subjects read an
argument against the existence of free will made them more likely to cheat on
a subsequent exam. Another found such subjects to be less helpful and more
aggressive. It is surely conceivable that knowing (or emphasizing) certain
truths about the human mind could have unfortunate psychological and/or
cultural consequences. However, I&rsquo;m not especially worried about degrading
the morality of my readers by publishing this book.</p></blockquote>

<p>(Again, Harris provides citations for the studies he references.) Harris goes on
to justify the last sentence with reference to his personal experience of losing
his sense of free will, stating that it has &ldquo;[increased his] feelings of
compassion and forgiveness, and [diminished his] sense of entitlement to the
fruits of my own good luck.&rdquo; I suppose his experience shows that it is
<em>possible</em> for losing one&rsquo;s belief in free will to have positive (or at least
neutral) psychological consequences, but given that research shows that this is
not the typical result, I don&rsquo;t think that a personal anecdote should be enough
to set us at ease. Of course, it should go without saying that this has no
bearing on the existence or non-existence of free will.</p>

<p>Harris&#8217; discussion of morality is a bit more satisfying. He observes that,
without a belief in free will, retributive justice becomes difficult if not
impossible to justify: &ldquo;Once we recognize that even the most terrifying
predators are, in a very real sense, unlucky to be who they are, the logic of
hating (as opposed to fearing) them begins to unravel.&rdquo; This is eminently
compatible with modern liberal understandings of how justice should operate.
Happily, the logic behind rehabilitation, incarceration for the safety of
society, and punishment as a means of deterrence, remains intact: &ldquo;It may seem
paradoxical to hold people responsible for what happens in their corner of the
universe, but once we break the spell of free will, we can do this precisely to
the degree that it is useful.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Compatibilism</h4>

<p>Astute readers may have noticed that I mentioned that Harris argues against
comaptibilism, but that thus far I have neglected to actually address those
arguments. That is because Harris&#8217; incompatibilist position is both somewhat
complex, and certainly the most controversial part of <em>Free Will</em>, at least
among philosophers.  Indeed, it is Harris&#8217; dismissal of compatibilism that
compelled professional philosopher Dan Dennett to write a
<a href="http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/reflections-on-free-will">criticism</a>
of the book that is, as Harris observed, &ldquo;nearly as long as the book itself.&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m going to refer to both Dennett&rsquo;s criticism and Harris&#8217;
<a href="http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-marionettes-lament">response to it</a>
throughout this section, which is unorthodox for a review, but in this case I
think those works make an extremely valuable addendum to the book itself, as
they expose (to a greater degree than the book does) the core of the
disagreement between Dennett&rsquo;s compatibilism and Harris&#8217; incompatibilism. (Where
I quote Harris, it will be from the text of <em>Free Will</em>, unless otherwise
noted.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consider what it would actually take to have free will,&rdquo; Harris writes. &ldquo;You
would need to be aware of all the factors that determine your thoughts and
actions, and you would need to have complete control over those factors.&rdquo; Harris
takes this as, I think, basically axiomatic, but compatibilists disagree.
Dennett writes that &ldquo;[s]uch &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; freedom is, of course, an incoherent
idea,&rdquo; which is true, but I think this is actually Harris&#8217; point: this is the
free will that people <em>suppose</em> they have, but when one thinks about the
implications of that belief, it is shown to be nonsensical.</p>

<p>Here we arrive at another disagreement between Dennett and Harris: Dennett
argues that Harris doesn&rsquo;t actually know what people in general think about free
will, and that &ldquo;suitably expressed questionnaires might well prove him wrong.&rdquo;
In fact, he provides a
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=E39CD0E070F0F373146843196443CF02?doi=10.1.1.364.2437">study</a>
which he purports does exactly that: polls conducted but <em>Nahmias et al.</em> appear
to show that people with no philosophical background actually do have
compatibilist notions of free will.</p>

<p>In his response to Dennett, Harris disputes the validity of this study, noting
that &ldquo;Nahmias and his coauthors repeatedly worry that their experimental
subjects didn&rsquo;t really understand the implications of determinism&mdash;and on
my reading, they had good reason to be concerned. &hellip; More than anything, this
research suggests that people find the idea of libertarian free will so
intuitively compelling that it is very difficult to get them to think clearly
about determinism.&rdquo; I have to say that I am in agreement with Harris here.
Having read the paper, it is not at all clear to me that <em>Nahmias et al</em>
accurately assessed their subjects&#8217; compatibilist or incompatibilist
beliefs. They write:</p>

<blockquote><p>Despite our efforts to induce participants to make their judgments based on a
conditional acceptance of the scenario, it is likely that some did not do so,
as evidenced by those who missed the manipulation check on the back of the
surveys, which tested whether they recognized the deterministic nature of the
scenario. Some of these participants may have even been expressing
incompatibilist intuitions, e.g., by asserting that Jeremy acts of his own
free will and then (mis)responding that the scenario therefore could <em>not</em>
have been describing a fully deterministic situation.</p></blockquote>

<p>I agree with Harris that this is a very valid concern, and I&rsquo;m not convinced
that the &ldquo;manipulation check&rdquo; (which isn&rsquo;t described in much detail) would have
been sufficient to account for it. <em>Nahmias et al</em> note that &ldquo;many&rdquo; participants
found the deterministic scenarios they used &ldquo;implausible or impossible,&rdquo; and
that in one case, &ldquo;almost all participants&rdquo; believed the scenario was
impossible. While participants&#8217; stated reasons for this belief varied, it seems
entirely plausible to me, and perhaps even likely, that a significant number of
participants could not effectively reason about the situations being presented
because of strong attachments to beliefs that contradict the scenarios&#8217;
premises.</p>

<p>In any case, Dennett argues that even if people do in fact have a natural
tendency towards libertarian incompatibilism (i.e. they believe in free will but
do not believe that it is compatible with determinism, and, perhaps
consequently, disbelieve determinism), this might just show &ldquo;that most people
are suffering from a sort of illusion that could be replaced by wisdom.&rdquo; He
seems to believe that the illusion in this &ldquo;folk conception of free will&rdquo; is
based on Cartesian dualism, and that the goal of compatibilism is to correct
replace this &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo; with something more &ldquo;scientifically sound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dennett wonders why Harris objects to this project and suggests that Harris is
arguing for Cartesian dualism, but this is a misconstrual: Harris is simply
drawing a distinction between what we consciously experience and all of the
unconscious processes our brains are engaged in at every moment, of which we
have no (subjective) knowledge. This is an important distinction, because
Dennett&rsquo;s compatibilist view of free will is predicated on the fact that &ldquo;we are
coterminous with everything that goes on inside our bodies, whether we are
conscious of it or not&rdquo; (Harris&#8217; words).  But although this is true, our
subjective, conscious experiences <em>are</em> actually only proxies for the underlying
neural states in our brains; one simply does not have conscious access to the
totality of his or her being. This is not simply a misconception that can be
corrected: it does seem to be, as Harris argues, a &ldquo;psychological fact,&rdquo; and I
would argue that it is probably also a <em>biological</em> fact. I am sure this is not
what Dennett hopes to replace with compatibilism, but I find myself confused
about the nature of the misunderstanding he feels he can correct.</p>

<p>I am reluctant to dismiss Dennett&rsquo;s arguments outright without first reading his
own books on the subject, but intuitively I find myself agreeing with Harris
that compatibilism seems like a cop out. I have spent quite some time trying to
get at the root of this intuitive feeling, and I&rsquo;ve found it difficult to do so
even with reference to Harris&#8217; arguments, which makes me suspicious of its
validity. But I think this paragraph by Dennett at least gets <em>close</em> to the
core of my skepticism about compatibilism:</p>

<blockquote><p>Contrast your competence at this moment [of deciding which card to play in
bridge] with the &ldquo;competence&rdquo; of a robotic bridge-playing doll that always
plays its highest card in the suit, no matter what the circumstances.  It
wasn&rsquo;t free to choose the six, because it would play the ace whatever the
circumstances were whereas if it occurred to you to play the six, you could do
it, depending on the circumstances. Freedom involves the ability to have one&rsquo;s
choices influenced by changes in the world that matter under the
circumstances.  Not a perfect ability, but a reliable ability. If you are such
a terrible bridge player that you can never see the virtue in ducking a trick,
playing less than the highest card in your hand, then your free will at the
bridge table is seriously abridged: you are missing the opportunities that
make bridge an interesting game. If determinism is true, are these real
opportunities?  Yes, as real as an opportunity could be: thanks to your
perceptual apparatus, your memory, and the well-lit environment, you are
caused/determined to evaluate the situation as one that calls for playing the
six, and you play the six.</p></blockquote>

<p>If we instead contrast a human chess player with a computer such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)">Deep Blue</a>,
we see that the latter has all of the faculties that Dennett claims give a
person free will: &ldquo;perceptual apparatus,&rdquo; memory, etc. Granted, the human player
could purposefully make a bad move, or quit the game, which the computer is not
free to do given its programming. But its programming could easily be changed to
permit those options as well. The point is that the computer behaves in a
determined manner according to the combination of its algorithm and the inputs
to that algorithm. Dennett seems to admit that we humans do exactly the same, if
with a more complex algorithm and broader range of inputs, but claims that this
is freedom nevertheless. But this does not seem to me to be a meaningful use of
the word <em>freedom</em>, and I think Harris is correct that it is not the sort of
freedom that most people suppose they have.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Despite the length at which I&rsquo;ve discussed <em>Free Will</em>, there is much that I did
not cover. If you found this discussion even moderately interesting, then you&rsquo;ll
certainly enjoy the book, and I do recommend reading both Dennett&rsquo;s criticism
and Harris&#8217; response to it as well. Philosophical concepts can be extremely
difficult to grapple with, and reading about them second-hand is rarely
beneficial to understanding.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed reading <em>Free Will</em>, and I found myself agreeing with pretty
much all of it, but I hesitate to call it <em>convincing</em>: I was already skeptical
of the idea of free will given our scientific understanding of determinism, so I
really didn&rsquo;t need much persuasion. For those who feel a deep sense of
attachment to the idea of free will, I am not sure Harris&#8217; arguments will be
sufficient to convince you otherwise.  As the debate between Dennett and Harris
demonstrates, the concept itself can be so nebulous as to make it difficult to
even discuss. This may also prove an obstacle for those who lack exposure to
philosophical reasoning, as the arguments can sometimes seem to devolve into
semantic disputes. Conversely, those with a <em>significant</em> philosophical
background may find <em>Free Will</em> uninteresting as they&rsquo;re likely to have read
similar arguments before. For everyone else, though, it comes highly
recommended: this is the rare sort of book that could really have a profound
impact on a person, and it can be read in a sitting, so there&rsquo;s really not much
to lose.</p>

<p>Well, except your sense of autonomy, I suppose.</p>

    <id>http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2014/10/08/dataclysm-who-we-are-when-we-think-no-ones-looking</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever read OkCupid&rsquo;s popular <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/">OkTrends</a> blog,
you&rsquo;re already familiar with the work of Christian Rudder. As OkCupid&rsquo;s resident
mathematician and one of its founders, he has been writing for years about
statistical trends related to dating and attraction, leveraging OkCupid&rsquo;s
vast database of traits about, and interactions between, its millions and millions
of users. OkTrends produced numerous interesting and surprising results, and it
developed a significant following before going quiet for the better part of
three years beginning in 2011.</p>

<p>Now, Rudder is back with
<a href="http://dataclysm.org/"><em>Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One&rsquo;s Looking</em></a>,
which expands on OkTrends by drawing from a wider variety of sources (including
Facebook, Google, and Twitter, in addition to OkCupid and other dating sites)
and discussing a more diverse set of topics.  Organized into three themed
sections which focus on, respectively, unity, division, and individuality, the
book explores what data can tell us about gender, sexuality, race, identity,
community, and other sociopolitical questions.  The discussion is consistently
balanced and neutral, which is important when dealing with such potentially
charged subjects, but Rudder also manages to inject enough of his personality
and characteristic style to keep the book enjoyable throughout.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Indeed, the OkTrends blog was popular not only for the fascinating observations
it produced, but also for Rudder&rsquo;s accessible and entertaining writing style,
and he continues this to great effect in Dataclysm. No mathematical or
statistical knowledge whatsoever is required to understand the topics discussed
in the book; data are presented in the form of simple graphs and explained using
plain English with a minimum of jargon.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this focus on accessibility also gives rise to my biggest
criticism of the book: on the spectrum of &ldquo;pop science&rdquo; writing, <em>Dataclysm</em> is
decidedly more pop than science. In and of itself, that isn&rsquo;t a problem per se,
but in many instances I felt that a more methodical approach could have led to a
broader and more productive discussion.  Rudder is not nearly thorough enough in
describing the methodology by which he arrived at his conclusions, nor in
presenting (or at least making available) salient facts about the data he used,
nor in exploring alternative hypotheses.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following graph of the &ldquo;perception of male vs. female
attractiveness&rdquo; from the introduction. On the x-axis is the average of all
ratings (on a 1-5 star scale) received by a user, and on the y-axis is the
percentage of all users that received that average rating:</p>

<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">
<img src="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/images/men_women_attractiveness.png" alt="Attractiveness of women as
rated by men and vice versa"/><br />
<small>Copyright 2014 Christian Rudder. Used under Fair Use.</small>
</div>


<br />


<p>Rudder explains:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our real-world data [of women&rsquo;s attractiveness as rated by men] diverges only
slightly (6 percent) from this formulaic ideal [of a symmetric beta
distribution] &hellip; it implies that the individual men who did the scoring are
likewise predictable, centered, and above all, unbiased&hellip; It&rsquo;s practically
common sense that men should have unrealistic expectations of women&rsquo;s looks,
and yet here we see it&rsquo;s just not true.</p>

<p>The red chart [of men&rsquo;s attractiveness as rated by women] is cenetered barely
a quarter of the way up the scale; only one in six guys is &ldquo;above average&rdquo; in
an absolute sense&hellip; [as an analogy,] translate this plot to IQ, and you have
a world where women think 58% of men are brain damaged.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is certainly interesting data in its own right, but I don&rsquo;t think Rudder
goes far enough in exploring what it means or why it might be the case. By
comparing against a similar random sample from a social network, he determines
that it is <em>not</em> because men on OkCupid are unusually ugly&mdash;this pattern
persists beyond dating sites. His hypothesis is simply that &ldquo;men and women
perform a different sexual calculus,&rdquo; and, quoting <em>Harper&rsquo;s Magazine</em>, he notes
that &ldquo;women are inclinded to regret the sex they had, and men the sex they
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is certainly a plausible explanation, and it&rsquo;s intuitively appealing, but
it also seems like a bit of a cop out based stereotypical beliefs about gender
differences. I&rsquo;d like to see data about how straight men and women rate the
attractiveness of people of their own gender&mdash;although not directly
analogous since it would be divorced from sexual desire, I suspect that the
results might raise questions about Rudder&rsquo;s hypothesis here.</p>

<p>In the interest of fairness, I must restate that his discussion takes place in
the book&rsquo;s introduction, so it&rsquo;s not representative of the length at which other
findings in the book are discussed. Most likely, it&rsquo;s just meant to pique the
reader&rsquo;s interest and serve as an example of the kind of data the book will
examine. Nevertheless, similar issues persist in later chapters of the book.
Consider this map of responses to the question &ldquo;Should flag burning be illegal?&rdquo;
among OkCupid users:</p>

<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">

question: Should flag burning be illegal?"/><br />

</div>


<br />


<p>Rudder claims that this map demonstrates that &ldquo;this is truly a nation defined by
its principles, or, as you can see, <em>two</em> nations: Urban and Rural.&rdquo; But to my
eyes, the colors overlap too much to make a meaningful distinction; this
really just looks like a population map. What&rsquo;s more, it appears to include
Canadian responses even though I can only assume that Rudder is referring the US
when he writes &ldquo;<em>a</em> nation,&rdquo; singular. And again, there is no discussion of
important methodological questions or possible confounding factors, such as
whether OkCupid&rsquo;s user base is disproportionately urban (which doesn&rsquo;t seem
unlikely to me), and whether or not that was corrected for if so.</p>

<p>Rudder anticipates criticism of his decision to eschew &ldquo;statistical esoterica,&rdquo;
and defends it as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t mention confidence intervals, sample sizes, p values, and similar
devices in <em>Dataclysm</em> because the book is above all a popularization of data
and data science&hellip; But like the spars and crossbeams of a house, the rigor is
no less present for being unseen. Many of the findings of the book are drawn
from academic, peer-reviewed sources. I applied the same standards to the
research I did myself&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>I fully accept that there is a place for and a value to &ldquo;popularization&rdquo; of
scientific fields, and that it&rsquo;s sensible to exclude complex statistical
measures which would be meaningless to most readers&hellip; <em>from the main body of
the text</em>. But I don&rsquo;t see why Rudder didn&rsquo;t even see fit to include these as
footnotes or endnotes, which the book does have. And with respect to the
academic research used, Rudder relegates all of his citations to endnotes, which
usually link back to the text referring to them, but are not linked to <em>from</em>
that text, which can make it very hard to match up specific statements with the
studies supporting them.</p>

<p>All of this criticism notwithstanding, I really enjoyed reading <em>Dataclysm</em>, and
I would heartily recommend it to anyone interested in gaining insight into the
social and political identities of (primarily American) Internet users. Anyone
interested in the burgeoning field of data science would also likely enjoy this
book. It&rsquo;s just worth noting that some of Rudder&rsquo;s conclusions should be taken
with a healthy dose of skepticism until they can be replicated with rigor that
<em>is</em> seen.</p>

    <updated>2014-05-18T21:02:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2014/05/18/the-elder-scrolls-online</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has been about a month and a half now since The Elder Scrolls Online was
released, and it&rsquo;s received
<a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-online">generally mixed reviews</a>.
Despite some undeniable technical issues and a handful of design flaws, it&rsquo;s a
great game and more than a bit underrated in my opinion; if you&rsquo;re a fan of The
Elder Scrolls <em>or</em> an MMO aficionado, you owe it to yourself to give ESO a try.
I&rsquo;ll explain why.</p>

<p>First, by way of qualifications, I should mention my history with the Elder
Scrolls series. I didn&rsquo;t play Arena or Daggerfall, so I haven&rsquo;t been following
the series since its inception, but Morrowind captured hundreds of hours worth
of my attention and made a huge impression on my taste in games&mdash;it was
unlike anything I&rsquo;d ever played at the time, and not even other Elder Scrolls
games have quite managed to recapture that magic for me.  Oblivion was, at
first, quite awe-inspiring, but once the captivating new graphics wore thin, it
ultimately seemed shallow and uninspired compared to Morrowind. Skyrim was a
return to form, with better and more varied environments, a more interesting
story, and improvements to game mechanics all around&mdash;in addition to, once
again, remarkable visuals. In short, I&rsquo;ve been an Elder Scrolls fan for more
than 12 years now, so although I don&rsquo;t go <em>all the way</em> back, I have a good
basis for comparison.</p>

<p>The Elder Scrolls Online came as a surprise, being announced less than a year
after Todd Howard indicated that
<a href="http://massively.joystiq.com/2011/08/31/bethesdas-todd-howard-not-interested-in-an-elder-scrolls-mmo/">Bethesda had no interest in an Elder Scrolls MMO</a>.
In fact, at that point ESO had been in development for four years, but Howard
may not have known and certainly would not have been at liberty to reveal that.
At any rate, my initial reaction was extreme skepticism; I doubted that the best
aspects of The Elder Scrolls could be preserved when introduced to the MMO
formula. As more details were revealed about the game&rsquo;s design and mechanics, I
grew more interested, but I after playing the beta I was again left with
lukewarm impressions. Still, something about it kept nagging at me, and I
couldn&rsquo;t stop watching Twitch streams of ESO as launch drew nearer. Eventually,
I decided to buy it just in time for early launch. Since then, I&rsquo;ve put in
nearly 150 hours, and that number would doubtless be much higher were it not for
the obligations of the real world.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There are a few things that the Elder Scrolls Online actually does much better
than any of the previous Elder Scrolls games, and if you&rsquo;ve any experience with
other MMOs, they&rsquo;ll likely come as a big surprise. One is the quests: they&rsquo;re
better written, more engaging, and more meaningful than those in previous Elder
Scrolls games, and in fact most games in general. The aggressive use of phasing
(an MMO technique which allows many players to co-exist in different versions of
the same space) allows your actions to actually have a lasting, visible
effect on the world, to an even greater extent than I can recall seeing in
previous Elder Scrolls games.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re given a quest to liberate a city from the clutches of the enemy du
jour, for instance, you&rsquo;ll <em>actually</em> liberate the city, cleansing the streets
of marauding monsters and opening up new shops and questgivers. Phasing is not a
novel concept, but I&rsquo;ve never seen it used so extensively or to such great
effect, and it really makes quests feel much more worthwhile than the typical
MMO tropes of <em>slaughter 10 pigs</em> or <em>collect 8 doodads</em>. Even when the
underlying quest mechanic is no more complex than one of those, the presentation
in ESO makes it <em>feel</em> much more interesting, and to a large extent, that&rsquo;s what
counts.</p>

<p>There are also actual moral choices in The Elder Scrolls Online. The game
doesn&rsquo;t yet offer the opportunity to steal from or kill NPCs and possibly face
the consequences as previous Elder Scrolls games have (though Zenimax promises
that they are planning such a feature), but many quests offer compelling moral
dilemmas. Will you allow the willing sacrifice of a loyal servant to cure a Duke
infected with lycanthropy? Will you show mercy to a traitor, knowing that your
choice could come back to haunt you? Will you use a powerful Necromantic
artifact to bolster the strength of your faction&rsquo;s army and possibly save the
lives of many soldiers, or will you destroy it lest it fall into the wrong hands
and lead to many more deaths?</p>

<p>The outcomes of these choices are never Earth-shattering (Nirn-shattering?), and
their effects on gameplay are varied, but they&rsquo;re more believable and relatable
than the choices in most games touted for their &ldquo;morality systems.&rdquo; There is no
omnipotent force here tallying up your Karmic balance and changing the colour of
your robes depending on whether you&rsquo;ve been good or bad. Instead, your choices
may determine whether certain NPCs live or die, or simply how they perceive you.
It sounds minor, but as some of the NPCs are recurring throughout the storyline,
the results of choices you make early in the game are often reflected later on.
More importantly, the moral choices in ESO are often actually <em>difficult</em>
because both options have costs associated with them, or because making the
upstanding choice means more work or less reward. Such is the morality of real
life; it&rsquo;s complicated and difficult because there&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t always a good option,
and virtuous choices often involve sacrifice. Very few games, even among those
praised for excellent narratives, get this right, so to see it done so well in
an MMO (a genre not known for good storytelling) is a pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>ESO has largely have the same cast of voice actors that have been utilized in
previous games, and overuse of some actors is a problem as always, but on the
whole I&rsquo;m impressed at how much content Zenimax was able to include while still
providing full voiceovers for all of the NPC dialogue. This is one of the things
that I didn&rsquo;t know I wanted until I actually experienced it, but it really makes
a huge difference in how interested I am in the story and the quests. I&rsquo;ve
played several MMOs, including World of Warcraft for more than 7 years, and I&rsquo;ve
never before bothered to actually read the quest text. In The Elder Scrolls
Online, I am not only listening to the quest dialogue, but I&rsquo;m also taking the
time to listen to supplemental NPC dialogue. It&rsquo;s well written and mostly pretty
well-acted, and there&rsquo;s a lot of good humour to be found as well.  Excellent
performances by big names like Michael Gambon, John Cleese and Jennifer Hale
make the main quest lines a real pleasure, too.</p>

<p>Of course, all of this would be for naught without solid game mechanics, and
fortunately ESO excels there, too. Combat mechanics have always been something
of a weak point for The Elder Scrolls series. Each new iteration improves on the
last, but conversely, each time one goes back to an older Elder Scrolls game one
wonders how he or she ever put up with it. Even as each new game brings
significant improvements, Bethesda has never quite captured a real sense of
weight and solidity in their combat mechanics. In contrast to (for instance)
Dark Souls, where the impact of each slash and thrust can almost be felt through
the controller, swordfighting in The Elder Scrolls often feels like swinging a
tennis racket through empty air.</p>

<p>Being an MMO, ESO&rsquo;s combat can&rsquo;t compete with the likes of Dark Souls, either&hellip;
but it feels surprisingly good. It&rsquo;s more fast-paced and dynamic than combat
ever has been in The Elder Scrolls, requiring a strategic approach and an
attentive eye to take on groups of enemies, particularly in the Veteran Ranks.
Weapon attacks feel good, with real differentiation between various type of
weapons, and the available abilities are varied enough to keep things
interesting.</p>

<p>The skill system in ESO is a nice change from MMO orthodoxy, being a blend of
the prescribed, XP-based systems seen in other games and the more open-ended
approach that The Elder Scrolls is known for, where skills are levelled up by
using them. Basically, there are a few skill lines unique to each of the game&rsquo;s
four classes, but there are many more that can be unlocked by any character.
Skill points are unlocked in a number of ways, including through levelling up
with XP, but how you can invest them is dictated by how far you&rsquo;ve advanced each
of your skill trees (which happens primarily by using the skills in the tree).
It might sound complex, but it&rsquo;s actually fairly intuitive in practice, and it
works quite well overall.</p>

<p>Of course, combat has never really been the focus of The Elder Scrolls, so many
will wonder whether ESO lives up to the standard of boundless exploration set by
previous games in the series. The answer is no; while I find the term a bit
distasteful, ESO could fairly be called a &ldquo;themepark&rdquo; MMO, and although there&rsquo;s
lots of world to explore, character progression through different zones is very
linear. In that respect, fans who enjoy The Elder Scrolls primarily for the open
world aspect may be disappointed. But there are a few ways in which I think ESO
makes up for it.</p>

<p>The first is delves, or public dungeons. These are much the same as the
dungeons, caves and ruins one can explore in other Elder Scrolls games. They are
littered across the overworld, and although they often offer quests, no quest or
NPC interaction is typically required to access them&mdash;they&rsquo;re best found
through exploration. In MMO terms, they&rsquo;re similar to instanced dungeons, with a
miniboss at the end that may drop higher-quality loot, but they&rsquo;re open to
everyone and designed to be completed solo. They&rsquo;re surprisingly effective at
breaking up the routine of solo levelling, and they do a lot to make ESO feel
like a real Elder Scrolls game.</p>

<p>Second, and more importantly in my opinion, is the diversity of environments in
ESO. This is another thing Bethesda has never been very good at: they pick a
single province of Tamriel with a single type of terrain and geography, and
while they do a marvelous job of realizing it, their single-minded focus can
lead to game worlds which become stale over time.  Morrowind and Skyrim had
enough variation that this wasn&rsquo;t a huge problem, but Oblivion was <em>terrible</em>
for it; everything looked the same, to the extent that exploring eventually felt
pointless.</p>

<p>While not all of Tamriel is yet playable in ESO, the game offers the opportunity
to visit many different provinces, including several that haven&rsquo;t been featured
since the days of Arena and Daggerfall. Along the way, you&rsquo;ll explore
grasslands, forests, rocky spires, deserts, swamps, tundra, and more. Exploring
new zones is a big aspect of what appeals to me about MMOs, and ESO does a much
better job of offering many different types of environments to explore than
previous Elder Scrolls games have. (That said, it&rsquo;s not perfect; in particular,
I wish the Daggerfall Covenant zones had more variation.)</p>

<p>Having said so many positive things about the game, it should be obvious that I
am a huge fan of The Elder Scrolls online, and would highly recommend it to MMO,
RPG and TES fans. There are many more good things I could write that I simply
don&rsquo;t have time to. However, I would be remiss to not also mention the problems
with the game, for there are several, and some of them are significant.</p>

<p>Bugs and performance/latency issues are at the top of the list, unfortunately.
Since the game came out, there have been many, many bugged quests, and although
I can&rsquo;t recall seeing one recently, patch notes and forum threads make it clear
that many still abound. Many class skills are currently bugged; although I don&rsquo;t
play one, I&rsquo;m told that this is particularly bad for Nightblades. Similarly,
there is an issue with passives not applying properly after your character dies
and resurrects, which is especially annoying in PvP.</p>

<p>ESO offers a weapon switching mechanic, but it&rsquo;s currently quite unreliable
because the amount of time it takes to execute is very inconsistent. This often
leads to accidental double-switches, or failed switches, which in turn
frequently leads to frustrating deaths. And in general, even without a high
ping, I&rsquo;ve experienced occasional latency issues which, when they occur, make
combat unpredictable and irritating. This happens most often in large PvP
battles for me, but I understand that latency issues in general are quite common
for European players.</p>

<p>PvP balance is another sore spot. Early on, the game was dominated by vampires,
and although they&rsquo;ve now received a well-deserved nerf, I still feel that their
balance could use more attention &ndash; not necessarily outright nerfs, but changes,
at least. Werewolves, in contrast, are so weak as to be almost pointless. (Both
lycanthropy and vampirism are &ldquo;diseases&rdquo; which any player can contract.) Class
balance is also less than stellar, although I won&rsquo;t go into specifics on that,
as it&rsquo;s a more controversial topic. Of course, this is no surprise in a brand
new MMO. Even World of Warcraft had remarkably poor PvP balance until <em>at least</em>
the launch of the Burning Crusade expansion, a full two years after the main
game launched.</p>

<p>Certain game systems, while good in theory, were not particularly well executed.
For instance, when you hit level 50 in ESO, you begin levelling through the
&ldquo;Veteran Ranks,&rdquo; and are given an opportunity to experience the other factions&#8217;
content and quests with levelled up (and generally more challenging) enemies.
Think of it as the MMO version of New Game+. As a recovering alt-a-holic, I like
that this gives me an incentive to experience more of the game&rsquo;s content without
having to roll a new character. But at the same time, because there are few
realistic alternative means of reaching max level, I dislike that it almost
precludes me from trying another class without having to play content I&rsquo;ve
already completed. (Experience from monsters is severely reduced in Veteran Rank
content, meaning that grinding is not viable. Hardcore players <em>hate</em> this.) The
fact that you can&rsquo;t choose which enemy faction to visit first is more than a
little bit annoying, too.</p>

<p>There are a host of other, less severe issues, which affect different players to
varying degrees. I&rsquo;m sure many players have &ldquo;pet&rdquo; issues which I&rsquo;ve failed to
mention here. I can&rsquo;t say that these issues don&rsquo;t affect the game experience; in
some cases, they can be quite significant. But, like it or not, this is par for
the course for a new MMO. I am confident that Zenimax is carefully monitoring
the game and taking customer feedback into account. Their progress on bug fixes
so far has been acceptable if not stellar (although I&rsquo;m sure not everyone would
agree), but I think it&rsquo;s clear that the game is stabilizing fairly quickly.
The upcoming content patch should include a number of major fixes that players
have been demanding, which I think will help a great deal.</p>

<p>The Elder Scrolls Online is not for everyone. It&rsquo;s not The Elder Scrolls VI, nor
is it the next World of Warcraft. If you expect either of those things, you will
likely be disappointed. What it is is an adept blend of those aspects that make
The Elder Scrolls great with all of the social, competitive and cooperative
elements that underpin good MMOs. Despite its flaws, I think it&rsquo;s an absolutely
excellent game overall, and one which will surely appeal to most of its target
audience if approached with an open mind. Even if the idea of a $15/month
subscription fee is offputting to you, you can easily experience enough content
in the first month to make the game well worth its $60 box price. I can&rsquo;t
recommend it enough.</p>

<p>Hope to see you in Tamriel!</p>

    <updated>2013-12-24T22:07:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2013/12/24/road-trip</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Five months ago, I <a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2013/07/30/road-trip/">left off my last post</a> having
just left Canyonlands National Park, heading further south to visit Bryce Canyon
and Zion National Parks. I had booked a motel for the evening in Panguitch,
Utah, which is a three or four hour drive from Moab. The drive there was
uneventful, with relatively little in the way of scenery. I mostly followed the
interstate, until about an hour outside of Panguitch, where I exited onto state
route 89.</p>

<p>Route 89 winds through scrub desert, farmland, and several very small towns
nestled between modest mountains. I arrived in Panguitch and discovered that it,
too, is very small. In contrast to Moab, though, it didn&rsquo;t seem to have much of
a tourist draw despite its proximity to Bryce Canyon. As a foreigner, I have to
admit that I felt some apprehension at this. Although everyone I&rsquo;d met in Utah
so far had been very friendly and welcoming, a small, isolated town like
Panguitch is the kind of place where I imagined that I could encounter a
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKcJ-0bAHB4">Top Gear-esque redneck mob</a>.
Granted, I wasn&rsquo;t driving around with a purposefully offensive slogan on my car,
nor do I really have a discernible accent, but I still felt like a pretty
obvious outsider with my Washington plates and conspicuous blue car with absurd
spoiler.  I was relieved, then, when I checked in at the New Western Motel and
was greeted at the front desk by an older Indian man (who I presume is also the
owner); it was good to see that the population of Panguitch isn&rsquo;t completely
homogeneous.</p>

<p>If you read the previous post you might recall that I had only slept for a few
hours the previous night, as I was up around 3:30am to get pictures of Delicate
Arch at night. That being the case, I was exhausted by the time I checked into
my room, so I decided to nap for a few hours before heading to Bryce Canyon. It
might have just been because I was so tired, but I distinctly recall thinking
that the bed in my motel room was among the most comfortable I had ever slept
in.</p>

<p>I woke up around five or six in the evening and went to grab dinner from &ldquo;The
Pizza Place&rdquo; in the nearby town of Tropic. Yes, it&rsquo;s literally just called &ldquo;The
Pizza Place.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a nice little family-run business, and the pizza was pretty
good. I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that they had several copies of the Book of
Mormon available for guests to peruse. That didn&rsquo;t surprise me, given that I was
in Utah, but I did find it strange that most if not all of the books seemed to
be written in Danish.</p>

<p>I made it to the Bryce Amphitheater in Bryce Canyon National Park just in time
for sunset, and took the opportunity to walk the Rim Trail and take some
pictures. Unfortunately, as it was quickly becoming dark, I didn&rsquo;t have time to
go on any of the hiking trails or explore the rest of the park. I contemplated
spending another day in Panguitch and going on a horseback tour of Bryce Canyon,
but ultimately opted to leave for Zion National Park the next morning so that
I&rsquo;d have more time there.<!-- more --></p>

<p>The next morning I made the 70-mile drive to Zion National Park. When I
arrived, I immediately knew that I&rsquo;d made the right choice in prioritizing Zion
over another day at Bryce Canyon. The descent into the canyon from the eastern
entrance is nothing short of spectacular. The Checkerboard Mesa is the first
sight to greet visitors entering from the east, and it alone is a pretty
remarkable formation, but it offers only the faintest hint at what awaits.</p>

<p>Walls of red stone rise up on either side as the road continues its descent into
the Zion-Mt. Carmel tunnel. The long, narrow tunnel was carved right into the
side of the canyon between during the years of 1927 to 1930. Occasional openings
in the side of the tunnel offer glimpses of the valley below, but the sight when
one finally emerges on the other side is truly breathtaking. It reminded me of
the descent into Yosemite Valley, but with towering walls of red sandstone
instead of granite. As impressive as the drive is, though, it doesn&rsquo;t even pass
through Zion Canyon proper.</p>

<p>I checked into my campground, set up my tent, and planned for my first hike:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_Landing">Angels Landing</a>.
It was still early in the afternoon, and far too hot for a 5 mile (8km) hike
with around 1500 feet (460m) of elevation gain. Luckily, my campground was also
an RV park and inn, so it had amenities such as a pool and showers. I lounged
around the pool until later in the afternoon when the temperature started to
drop, and then, carrying my tripod, camera, and an ample supply of water, hopped
on the canyon bus.</p>

<p>Due to the limited area of the canyon, and to reduce environmental impact,
visitors aren&rsquo;t allowed to drive or park in Zion Canyon itself. Instead, the
park operates a free shuttle bus up and down the canyon, complete with narration
describing the history of the canyon and the significance of each of location it
stops at. While informative, the narration gets a bit tiring after the third or
fourth time you hear it, which makes one feel sorry for the park staff who are
subjected to it daily. On the first bus I took, a woman who I assumed to be an
off-duty park employee entertained us by reciting word for word, but in a very
sarcastic tone, several minutes of the narration.</p>

<p>The climb up to Angels Landing starts off with a deceptively gentle walk along
the Virgin River at the bottom of the canyon, but then quickly climbs upward
along a series of increasingly steep switchbacks. It was still hot enough out to
make the upward trek thoroughly exhausting. Thankfully, the aptly named
Refrigerator Canyon offered some respite. Encountered about half way through the
hike, the small box canyon is consistently several degrees cooler than ambient
temperatures.</p>

<p>At the end of Refrigerator Canyon, the trail ascends
<a href="http://www.zionnational-park.com/images/album2/pages/angels-landing-ef_jpg.htm">Walter&rsquo;s Wiggles</a>,
a long set of tight, steep switchbacks, and then emerges atop a spine of
cliff that culminates in Angels Landing itself. This is where the trail really
gets fun&mdash;or terrifying, depending on your perspective. I don&rsquo;t consider
myself to be particularly afraid of heights, but the view down to the valley
floor is truly dizzying, even before one reaches the top of Angels Landing. And
between the top of the of the Wiggles and the Landing, there are still hundreds
of vertical feet to climb along a twisting, rocky, extremely narrow trail where
a slip to either side means certain death. So steep is this section of trail
that much of it is spent pulling oneself upward along sections of chain that the
National Park Service has anchored into the rock. It&rsquo;s remarkable that
<a href="http://www.nps.gov/zion/frequently-asked-questions-about-zions-hiking-trails.htm">only a handful of people have died at Angels Landing</a>.
Did I mention that I was carrying a tripod and several pounds of camera
equipment the whole way up?</p>

<p>Arriving at the summit, though, the perilous hike proved to be more than
worthwhile as I was afforded a beautiful view of Zion Canyon. The brilliant
green foliage along the valley floor gives way to majestic orange cliffs, which
turn fiery red as the sun sinks in the distance. Words can&rsquo;t do it justice, and
frankly, neither can my photography, but I tried nevertheless:</p>

</ul>


<p>Later that evening, I drove back along the Zion-Mount Carmel highway, stopping a
few miles from the east entrance to try to get a few pictures of the stars above
the canyon. That didn&rsquo;t work out as well as I had hoped, but I did see another
scorpion!</p>

</ul>


<p>The next day, I set off to hike
<a href="http://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/thenarrows.htm">The Narrows</a>, a 16-mile
(25km) long, 20-30 foot (6-9m) wide, 2000 foot (610m) deep gorge carved by the
Virgin River.  What makes The Narrows unique is that there is no hiking trail at
all: the hike is actually undertaken <em>in the river</em>. As such, it can vary
greatly in difficulty depending on the season; during months where the water
level is high, it can be all but impassable, whereas in the summer it tends to
be relatively easy with water ranging from ankle-deep to waist-deep. As I was in
Zion during July, the water level was quite low.</p>

<p>Even so, such an atypical hike requires extra preparation, so I walked across
the road from my campground to the
<a href="http://www.zionadventures.com/">Zion Adventure Company</a> and picked up the
required gear.  This consisted of a pair of canyoneering shoes and neoprene
socks, a walking stick, and a waterproof bag for my camera equipment. I ended up
finding the walking stick to be more of a burden than a boon, and the waterproof
bag wasn&rsquo;t really necessary either given the low water levels, but it&rsquo;s better
to be safe than sorry with expensive camera equipment.</p>

<p>A word of advice for anyone planning to hike The Narrows, though: if you rent
canyoneering shoes, make sure they fit <em>with plenty of room to spare.</em> They&rsquo;ll
shrink in the water, so shoes that are a comfortable fit at the beginning of the
day can become very, very uncomfortable after several hours in the river. I
learned this the hard way: by the end of my hike, I could barely walk, and much
of the toenail on my big toe on my left foot ended up turning black and falling
off. Five months later, it&rsquo;s finally <em>almost</em> completely grown back.</p>

<p>Aside from that slightly painful mistake on my part, though, The Narrows proved
to be a truly amazing hike, unlike anything I&rsquo;ve ever done before. Looking
thousands of feet up the sheer canyon wall offers a new perspective on the
enormity of Zion Canyon, and there&rsquo;s something new to see in every corner of the
canyon: foliage sprouting out of the ancient stone, birds circling overhead,
gurgling springs pouring from cracks in the walls, and all around, the
ever-changing Virgin River.</p>

<p>There are two ways to hike The Narrows. Starting from the top down, it&rsquo;s a
16-mile hike, which the National Park Service estimates will take about 12
hours. Unfortunately, this route requires two permits, one of which is very
sought-after and therefore difficult to get. Not having either permit, I was
left with the bottom-up hike, which is a 10-mile (16km) round trip if you go all
the way to the mandatory turn-around point at Big Spring, which I did. I also
took the optional side-trip into Orderville Canyon, which added another mile to
the hike for a total of around 11 miles (18km).</p>

<p>The first few miles of the hike were very busy, probably owing both to how
spectacular the views on the hike are, and how refreshing the cool waters of the
Virgin River are on hot days in Zion. Luckily, most people seem to stop and turn
back around Orderville Canyon, which is about 2.5 miles into the hike. After the
Orderville fork, the main canyon becomes very narrow in spots&mdash;hence the
name. Of course, this also means that the river is much deeper in a few areas.
Even with the low water levels, I had to wade through several waist-deep pools
with my camera bag held above my head.  There was even one pool deep enough that
I would have had to swim across it, but I managed to find an alternate route by
sneaking behind a colossal boulder in the river.</p>

<p>After five miles of walking upstream, I reached Big Spring, which is exactly
what it sounds like: a large spring pouring into the river from the canyon wall.
With the water low, it&rsquo;s also a perfect spot to stop and relax. There&rsquo;s a nice
sandbar to sit on, and the canyon is wide enough that the afternoon sun bakes
the sandbar to a pleasantly warm temperature. There&rsquo;s also a fairly deep pool
in the river opposite the sandbar, adjacent to the spring itself; this I found
to be perfect for diving and swimming, and a nice way to cool off when the sun
became too warm.</p>

<p>I met a group of students and their football coach from a Mormon school in Provo
(if I recall correctly) at the spring. They were all very friendly, and I
encountered them again several times on my way back down the canyon, so we ended
up chatting about various subjects. Learning that I&rsquo;m from Canada but working in
the US, they were interested to hear how Canadians can acquire US work visas.
This is something I&rsquo;ve been asked about several times; it seems that some
aspects of the US immigration system are almost universally unknown. I don&rsquo;t
mean that to sound judgmental, though&mdash;it&rsquo;s merely an (I think) interesting
observation. Most people have little reason to know, and I can&rsquo;t claim to
understand in detail how immigration works in Canada.</p>

<p>They also mentioned that they knew someone who was currently on a mission in
Edmonton, which is where I went to school. I was a little surprised to learn
that Mormons from the US actually go on missions in Canada; I guess I had
pictured missions primarily taking place in poorer countries where the
missionaries can help the locals with construction, education, health care, and
so forth, in addition to their evangelism. I didn&rsquo;t really ask about it, though;
mostly we talked about how mind-numbingly cold winters in Edmonton can be.</p>

<p>On my way back down the river, I stopped briefly in Orderville Canyon. It&rsquo;s a
short detour, and well worth it. Orderville is narrower than the main canyon,
and a bit more challenging to hike in some spots. After one of the first several
bends, there&rsquo;s a long straight stretch with a clear view to a jutting peak above
the canyon, which offers a phenomenal sense of the scale of the stone around
you. Unfortunately, I couldn&rsquo;t effectively photograph this. At the turn-around
point, Orderville rewards those who take the time to hike it with a small
waterfall.</p>

</ul>


<p>Sadly, I only had a couple days to spend in Zion, so the next day I packed up my
tent and started the long drive back to Redmond. The fastest route would have
been to back north through Idaho, essentially following the same route I&rsquo;d
arrived on. I wanted the drive to be interesting, though, so instead I headed
southwest to St. George, Utah, then through the northwest corner of Arizona and
on to Las Vegas.
(<a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2013/07/30/road-trip/">There&rsquo;s a map in my first post.</a>) From there, I
drove northwest along the California-Nevada border. The GPS in my car can be
extremely uncooperative at times, particularly where seasonal roads are
involved, so I ended up following an unnecessarily circuitous route, crossing
the state border no fewer than 5 times. I did find some beautiful roads, though;
in particular, the Robert M. Jackson Memorial Highway (California State Route
89) near Leviathan Peak. I reached the peak just as the sun was setting, and the
view was gorgeous.</p>

<p>I stayed the night in South Lake Tahoe. It was already night when I arrived, and
I didn&rsquo;t have much time to explore the next day given how much driving I still
had left to do. Still, driving around the lake re-emphasized the beauty of the
area; Lake Tahoe now has a high spot on my list of places that I have to visit.</p>

<p>From Tahoe, I made another detour back into Nevada, through Carson City, and
then back through California up to Oregon. Northern California reminds me quite
a bit of the southern interior of British Columbia, but other than that, there
wasn&rsquo;t much to see. As for the drive through Oregon, the only thing I want to
say about it is that south-central Oregon doesn&rsquo;t seem to be very interesting
(except for Crater Lake, which I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to stop at), and that speed
limits in the state are far too low. 55mph on the interstate makes for a long,
boring drive.</p>

<p>So, that&rsquo;s it! I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed reading about my adventures. I try to do at
least one long road trip each year, so if you have suggestions about where I
should go next year, let me know.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love visiting new places. I&rsquo;ve lived in the United States for just over a year
now, and one of my favourite things about this country is how vast it is and how
many opportunities it presents for exploration. Canada is just slightly larger
than the United States, but it&rsquo;s also very sparsely populated north of, say,
Edmonton, so practically speaking I think one can explore much more of the
States while still maintaining access to the comforts of civilization.</p>

<p>To that end, I try to go on at least one long road trip every year. I&rsquo;m also one
of those people who actually enjoy driving, even for absurdly long stretches of
time; anything up to 12 hours per day on the road is fairly comfortable for me,
and even beyond that I don&rsquo;t find long trips all that tiring. I&rsquo;d much, much
rather drive 12 hours in my car than take a two hour plane trip.</p>

<p>My new car was also begging to be broken in on a long road trip. Although I had
a bit of a <a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2013/06/09/the-subaru-saga/">rocky start with it</a>, all of the
issues have now been sorted out (or at least as sorted out as they&rsquo;ll ever be),
so it offered another compelling reason to take a long trip. And so it was that
I booked the 5th to 12th of July off of work and embarked on a 3,378 mile
(5,436km) drive from Redmond, Washington through Oregon, Idaho, and Nevada to
Utah, and then back home through Arizona, Nevada, California and Oregon.</p>

<p>The first couple days of my trip were uneventful and consisted mostly of a lot
of driving. I took the scenic route through Washington and stopped to check out
the I-90 Vantage Bridge over the Columbia River near the Ginkgo State Petrified
Forest, as well as Palouse Falls in the southeast. I didn&rsquo;t actually get off the
freeway at the Petrified Forest, but from what I could see, it didn&rsquo;t seem to
live up to its name. I didn&rsquo;t see any trees, or indeed any wood, petrified or
not. I&rsquo;m not sure how a bunch of sand and scrub grass qualify as a forest. On
the bright side, the view from the rest area on the I-90 east of the river was
pretty spectacular.</p>

<p>Palouse Falls was a lot more impressive. Depending on conditions, the falls are
up to 200 feet (61 metres) high. Some crazy person named Tyler Bradt recently
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrveNdW_sj0">survived going over the falls in a kayak</a>&mdash;uninjured,
even! The view from the state park campground isn&rsquo;t ideal, but I didn&rsquo;t have
time to find a way down to the river and back up, so I continued on to Haines,
Oregon, where I caught some decent Fourth of July fireworks, and then spent the
night in Ontario, Oregon.</p>

<p>On the second day I drove through Idaho, Nevada and Utah. The tag line on
Idaho&rsquo;s license plates is &ldquo;Scenic Idaho,&rdquo; and while I don&rsquo;t doubt that it&rsquo;s true
of some parts of the state, it&rsquo;s probably not referring to the southwestern bit.
Other than some cool gorges, there wasn&rsquo;t much to see. I stopped at Malad Gorge
State Park to take a few photos, and then continued on to Wendover, Utah, where
the Bonneville Salt Flats are located.</p>

<p>I was looking forward to driving on the salt flats and trying to hit my car&rsquo;s
top speed of 158mph (254km/h), but unfortunately it had been raining before I
arrived and the flats were covered in a thin layer of water. I drove around a
little bit anyway to put my car&rsquo;s AWD system to the test, but I didn&rsquo;t go very
fast or venture very far from the paved road&mdash;it&rsquo;s not recommended to drive
on the salt flats when they&rsquo;re flooded as it becomes very easy to get stuck,
apparently in some cases to the point that your vehicle becomes unrecoverable.
I&rsquo;ll have to go back to the salt flats another time when they&rsquo;re dry, but at any
rate, they were still very pretty and it was fun to get my car a bit dirty.</p>

<p>Continuing on from the Salt Flats, I drove through Salt Lake City, which is
absolutely beautiful. As I drove in from the west, the sunset painted the
mountains to the east of the city brilliant red, and a thunderstorm in Provo to
the south periodically lit the sky with flashes of lighting. Sadly, I didn&rsquo;t
have time to find a vantage point to get any pictures of this, as it was
starting to get dark and I still had a few hours of driving ahead of me. I
stopped for dinner in Salt Lake City and then continued on to Price, Utah, where
I spent the night.</p>

<p>The third day of my trip was Saturday, the 6th of July, and I arrived in Moab,
Utah around noon, where it was already over 100&deg;F (38&deg;C). I checked into
my campsite and explored the town briefly. I was reluctant to go hiking in the
oppressive heat, but it showed no signs of letting up before dusk, so I bought
several bottles of water and Powerade and headed to Arches National Park.</p>

<p>Arches is remarkably beautiful. Of all the places I visited on my trip, it was
second only to Zion National Park. Even if I had gone to Zion first, Arches
still would have been amazing, but as I hadn&rsquo;t yet been to Zion it was truly awe
inspiring. Arches is also a very accessible national park; the scenic drive
through the park alone is impressive, and many of the most impressive arches
require only short hikes to see up close. That said, for someone from a northern
climate such as myself, a two mile hike in 100-degree heat is a lot harder than
one might expect.</p>

<p>I started with Landscape Arch, which was suitably picturesque and monumental for
my first arch. From there, I tried to continue on to Double O Arch, which is
further along the same trail. But between the extreme heat and a harsh wind that
coated my face, eyes, mouth and camera with orange-red sand, I decided to turn
back before I reached Double O Arch; with so many other arches to see, I didn&rsquo;t
want to exhaust myself visiting the first few arches. I stopped at Pine Tree
Arch and Tunnel Arch on the way back. Tunnel Arch is aptly named because it&rsquo;s
really more of a hole through a large fin of rock, on its way to becoming an
arch but not quite there yet. Pine Tree Arch was nice, but difficult to
photograph without a wide angle lens.</p>

<p>I then made the short hikes to Skyline Arch and Sand Dune Arch, the latter of
which is one of the most picturesque arches in the park, in my opinion. Being in
a canyon, the soft sand around the arch is also delightfully cool on a hot day.
Were it not so busy, it would be the perfect place for a nap. Behind the arch,
there&rsquo;s a crevice that one can easily walk into for a change of perspective, and
it&rsquo;s quite easy to climb onto the top of the arch as well.</p>

<p>Finally, with sunset coming on, I hiked up to Delicate Arch. I waited until the
sun had gone down to try to get some long exposures, but I was mostly
unsuccessful, partly for lack of skill and partly because I didn&rsquo;t have all of
the equipment I needed. Most importantly, I didn&rsquo;t have a remote shutter
trigger, which meant I could only take long exposures on a timer, limiting me to
a maximum exposure length of 30 seconds. I resolved to come back again to try to
get some night time and sunrise shots after buying a remote shutter trigger.</p>

<p>Back at my tent as I was getting ready for bed that evening, I left the door
flap open for probably about a minute or two while I moved some of my gear from
the car into the tent.  Upon getting in the tent and turning on my flashlight, I
discovered that that minute or two had been long enough for a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solifugae">solfugid</a> to invite itself in. My dad
is an entomologist so I&rsquo;m not particularly frightened of insects or arachnids,
though I&rsquo;m certainly not as welcoming of them as he is, nor, obviously, as
knowledgeable about them. The solfugid was pretty alarming because at the time I
didn&rsquo;t actually know what it was; I only knew that it was very fast and had very
large mandibles, and that Utah (in contrast to everywhere I&rsquo;ve ever lived) does
actually have venomous arthropods.</p>

<p>After a lot of swearing and awkward attempts to keep my eye on its rapid
confused scurrying while blindly reaching for something that I could safely trap
it in, I managed to scoop it up in a cooking pot and throw it outside. I then
searched the Internet for something like &ldquo;insect with 10 legs with 2 huge front
legs&rdquo; and found out what it was, and that they&rsquo;re relatively harmless.  (When I
talked to my dad about it later, he was quick to point out that solfugids are
arachnids, not insects, and that the two front &ldquo;legs&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t actually legs at
all. He also said that he was jealous of my encounter as he&rsquo;s never seen one in
the wild.) I still wouldn&rsquo;t want to get bitten by those big mandibles, though.</p>

<p>Sunday was just as crushingly hot as Saturday had been (and, indeed, as the
entire next week would be). To cool down during the hottest part of the day, I
took a trip up the Colorado River with <a href="http://www.moabjett.com/">Moab Jett</a>. I
didn&rsquo;t find the scenery all that remarkable, but the trip was nevertheless a lot
of fun and very refreshingly cool. Because it is a jet boat with no external
propeller, by maintaining a high rate of speed the boat is able to skim over
water only a few inches deep, and at various points on the tour the captain puts
the boat into a spin, soaking everyone on board with refreshing river water. In
retrospect, I could easily have brought my phone along in a couple ZipLoc bags
for photos, but at the time I wasn&rsquo;t sure just how wet the tour would be; hence,
there are no photos.</p>

<p>After the jet boat tour I decided to check out Dead Horse Point State Park. I
should mention at this point that I had been using my car&rsquo;s built-in GPS to
navigate throughout the trip. It has a couple nice features such as the ability
to input multiple waypoints on the way to a destination, but other than that,
it&rsquo;s pretty bad and is one of my few significant complaints about the car. It
does a poor job of choosing optimal routes relative to software like Bing,
Google or Apple Maps, and is abysmal at estimating how long a drive will take.
And, as I discovered, it also has a pretty broad definition of what qualifies as
a road.</p>

<p>Mapping a route from Moab to Dead Horse Point, I was presented with two options,
and I chose the &ldquo;alternate&rdquo; route which I thought would be a more scenic drive.
And indeed it was&mdash;but it also turned out to traverse Long Canyon Road, a
somewhat steep and rocky 4x4 trail from the Colorado River basin up to the Dead
Horse Point mesa. There are settings in the GPS to enable or disable routing
through major highways and toll roads, so I&rsquo;m surprised that there&rsquo;s no way to
filter out dirt roads (and that such an option isn&rsquo;t turned on by default), but
I wasn&rsquo;t actually bothered about it taking me on a 4x4 trail; I figured it would
be another good chance to try out my Subaru AWD.</p>

<p>The clearance of my car is too low for serious offroading, and my &ldquo;performance&rdquo;
street tires don&rsquo;t have the grip necessary for steep sandy slopes, but
nevertheless my car performed admirably. I saw a few trucks and SUVs on the
trail, but I didn&rsquo;t encounter any other cars. I drove up to just beyond  the
giant fallen rock before Pucker Pass, at which point the road was fairly steep
and covered in extremely soft sand which afforded my tires almost no traction. I
think I probably could have made it through and continued to the end of the
trail, but as I was alone, dozens of miles from the nearest city, and with no
cellular reception, I didn&rsquo;t want to push my luck, so I turned around and went
back down the canyon and back to the interstate. (I feel like I&rsquo;m letting other
Subaru owners down by admitting that, but better safe than sorry!) The road
probably doesn&rsquo;t look that bad in my photos, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be for a vehicle
with proper tires and more clearance, but keep in mind that the places I stopped
for pictures were the least steep and bumpy parts.</p>

<p>As an aside, on my way back, right by the intersection of Long Canyon Road and
the highway, I saw a large matte black Ford truck with a huge stabilized camera
rig on the back, as well as a Mustang with fake bullet holes and a missing
taillight on a flatbed tow truck. Clearly filming for some movie was going on in
the area. Fast &amp; The Furious 7? Transformers 4? Who knows.</p>

<p>Finally, more than an hour later than I had expected to, I arrived at Dead Horse
Point. The view of the Colorado River from Dead Horse Point is well worth the
drive, but once you&rsquo;ve seen it, there&rsquo;s not much else to do in the state park,
so I didn&rsquo;t spend too long there. As I was leaving, a beautiful but ephemeral
rainbow presented itself to the east, punctuated by flashes of lightning from a
storm that had  rolled in to the east of Moab. Sadly I couldn&rsquo;t get any decent
pictures of this.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day I had picked up a remote shutter trigger for my camera from a
small photography store in Moab, so with my resolution to return to Delicate
Arch for sunrise in mind, I went to bed as early as the heat would allow. I woke
up around 3:30am on Monday and drove back out to Arches. Equipped with a
flashlight, my camera and tripod, and my new shutter trigger, I hiked up to the
arch in complete darkness and waited for the sun to rise.</p>

<p>I actually arrived much earlier than I needed to for sunrise, because I had been
hoping to get some photos of the arch with stars behind it. Unfortunately this
is where I discovered another piece of equipment my photography kit is lacking.
Obviously auto-focus doesn&rsquo;t work in low light, let alone complete darkness, but
I discovered that it&rsquo;s also nearly impossible to correctly manually focus on an
object for a long exposure when you can&rsquo;t actually <em>see the object.</em> I thought I
might be able to accomplish this by trial and error, but doing so turned out to
be time consuming and unreliable.</p>

<p>I later did some research and discovered that one of the preferred solutions to
this problem is to carry a laser pointer with one&rsquo;s photographic equipment. By
shining the laser on the object you want to focus on, you&rsquo;ll have a small,
bright point, and you&rsquo;ll know that your image is in focus when that point is
readily visible through the viewfinder. While I&rsquo;m on the subject of photography,
I also learned that on lenses with optical image stabilization, the
stabilization must be turned off for long exposures, or fine movements in the
stabilization mechanism will result in a blurry image.</p>

<p>Anyway, once the sun came up I was able to get some reasonably nice photos,
although I was somewhat compositionally limited by the swarm of people who had
arrived around 6am. Now that I was able to see where I was going, I took the
opportunity to explore the natural stone amphitheatre below the arch, as well as
the jutting outcropping of rock to the south. Here I found a number of lizards
warming themselves in the morning sun.</p>

<p>Returning from Arches, I made a brief stop in Canyonlands National Park to see
the Mesa Arch. Canyonlands is a very big park, which makes it quite time
consuming to explore. I was eager to move on to Bryce Canyon and Zion, so after
seeing the Mesa Arch (which is very impressive and well worth going to
Canyonlands for), I decided to start driving to Panguitch, where I&rsquo;d check out
Bryce Canyon and spend the night. I&rsquo;ll save the rest for part II, as Bryce
Canyon and Zion National Parks were even more spectacular than Arches and
Canyonlands, and are more than deserving of their own post.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Or &ldquo;buying used cars is the worst and I will never do it ever again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I recently purchased a new-to-me 2011
<a href="http://www.subaru.com/vehicles/impreza-wrx/index.html">Subaru WRX STI</a> sedan.
I had been thinking about buying a new car for a long time&mdash;since I
graduated, more or less. Until I bought my Subaru, I owned an ageing Honda Civic
(1997, to be precise).  While it was a very capable and extremely reliable car
throughout the many years I owned it for, it was old enough that it lacked some
of the conveniences one expects in a car these days, such as power locks and
windows, and most importantly, air conditioning.  The lack of air conditioning
in particular made it  less than ideal for summer road trips, and more
importantly, it was in need of some moderately expensive maintenance, and it
didn&rsquo;t seem to make sense to me to spend much money on it given that the overall
value of the car was fairly low.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t go on many test drives before I purchased my Subaru, but I didn&rsquo;t feel
the need to; I had already spent months watching reviews, reading forums,
comparing specs and window shopping on AutoTrader. I knew I wanted a sporty car
with plenty of horsepower for under $40,000, and all-wheel drive was a must as I
go to the mountains nearly every weekend in the winter and almost as often in
the summer. Besides the STI, the Evo, MazdaSpeed3, and the Golf R were the best
contenders, but each had significant drawbacks with regard to my personal
preferences. The Evo has a notoriously lacklustre interior (not that the STI is
<em>a lot</em> better, to be fair); I don&rsquo;t like the way the MazdaSpeed3 looks, and the
Golf comes with the reputation of higher maintenance costs for German cars.</p>

<p>I also really like the Subaru community.
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/subaru">/r/subaru</a> is the largest manufacturer-specific
subreddit, and in addition to forums like <a href="http://forums.nasioc.com/">NASIOC</a>,
it comprises a vibrant community of enthusiastic Subaru owners. Of course other
brands have significant followings as well&mdash;particularly VW&mdash;but my
impression of the Subaru community is that it&rsquo;s less elitist and, in contrast to
the others, puts as much emphasis on what one can <em>do</em> with the cars as on the
cars themselves. To &ldquo;go Subaruing&rdquo; is a popular term for going out into the mud
or the snow or the sand or the bush and getting the car wet and dirty, and
having a ton of fun in the process.</p>

<p>The STI, then, was the clear winner in my eyes.  Truth be told, a WRX probably
would have been more than sufficient for my needs, but I generally prefer to put
down the extra money and be sure that I&rsquo;m getting the best product. And hey, one
only has so long to exercise the opportunity to be young and irresponsible!</p>

<h2>Finding My Car</h2>

<p>So, finally I decided to bite the bullet, and I found a used STI that looked
really nice on Craigslist. On March 9th, 2013, I went with a friend to
<a href="http://www.rentonsubaru.com/index.htm">Walker&rsquo;s Renton Subaru</a>
to look at the vehicle and take it for a test drive.  Walker&rsquo;s is sort of two
separate dealerships on the same lot; there&rsquo;s the Subaru dealership and there&rsquo;s
also <a href="http://www.rentonmazda.com/index.htm">Walker&rsquo;s Renton Mazda</a>.  Obviously
they&rsquo;re both under the same ownership, and it seems that salespeople on one lot
can sell cars on the other lot as well; the car I went to look at was listed as
being at the Subaru dealership, but I ultimately ended up dealing primarily with
the Mazda dealership because that is where the salesman I first contacted
worked.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dealerrater.com/sales/Ken-Palmer-review-33450/">Ken Palmer</a> was the
salesperson I dealt with. Both he and the dealership itself have very high
ratings on the site that link points to (DealerRater.com), which is surprising
to me because dealing with them (particularly the dealership; I have less
animosity for Ken) has been by far the worst experience I&rsquo;ve ever had as a
consumer.  The reason for that will become clear shortly, but bear in mind that
even before I discovered the major issue which prompted this post, I would not
have said that my buying experience with Walker&rsquo;s was <em>good</em> by any means.
Incidentally, their
<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/walkers-renton-subaru-renton-2">Yelp ratings</a> are
considerably lower, although there aren&rsquo;t as many reviews on Yelp.</p>

<p>We went to the Mazda dealership and I took a look at the car. It looked great;
the paint job was (and is) in great shape for the most part, although there were
a number of small nicks on the rear doors where the body flares out into the
wide wheel arches, as well as some on the front bumper pieces where the fog
lights would go (this car doesn&rsquo;t have fog lights).  I didn&rsquo;t really notice
those at the time, but they&rsquo;re minor and I doubt they would have influenced my
purchasing decision anyway. There was also some minor cosmetic damage to the
interior: a bit of chipping on the painted bezel around the satellite navigation
unit and centre vents, a white mark on the driver&rsquo;s side between the centre
console and the steering wheel, another on the glove box, and a minor nick in
the steering wheel leather. There is some minor curb rash on wheels which I
somehow failed to notice before I bought the car, but it&rsquo;s not noticeable from a
distance of more than a few feet. Overall the car appeared to be in excellent
condition.</p>

<p>We went for a test drive and I really liked the way it handled. Traffic was
moderately heavy and I didn&rsquo;t get much of a chance to open up the taps and
really test our the car&rsquo;s power on the route we took.  Truth be told, I wasn&rsquo;t
even doing a particularly good job driving it, as I&rsquo;d driven a manual car a
grand total of two times before that test drive, including once on the way to
the dealership&mdash;I drove my friend&rsquo;s car there to get some additional
practice<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Even so, I could tell then that I would grow to love the car
more and more as I learned how to drive it better, and in retrospect I was
completely correct about that.</p>

<p>During the test drive I noticed that the exhaust was very loud&mdash;not
irritatingly so, and I loved the way it sounded, but I thought it couldn&rsquo;t
possibly be stock so I asked Ken. He confirmed that it was stock, which at the
time I naïvely accepted. I later found out that this was not true.  I believe
that the downpipe, midpipe and catalytic converter are stock, but the tail pipe
seems to have been replaced with a
<a href="http://shop.namelessperformance.com/sti-sedan-axleback/">Nameless Performance AxelBack Muffler Delete</a>.
That&rsquo;s strike number one against Ken. I like the exhaust, and I don&rsquo;t mind that
it&rsquo;s aftermarket, but he should have done his research on the vehicle before
trying to sell it to me. If he wasn&rsquo;t sure whether or not the exhaust was stock,
he could have answered honestly and we could have looked it up to find the
correct answer. It irritates me that I was given false information, and while
everyone makes mistakes, given what I now know I can&rsquo;t help but ascribe this to
him valuing presentation over honesty.</p>

<h2>This Is Where It Gets Unpleasant</h2>

<p>We got back to the dealership and I decided that I liked the car enough that I
was prepared to sit down and negotiate on the price.  The list price on the
Craigslist ad I&rsquo;d responded to was around $32,000, but I told Ken that I was not
prepared to pay that much and that I was looking for $29,000. He said there was
no way he could go that low, as the price they were offering was already low in
his opinion. For the record, the Blue Book value for the car as I bought it is
currently $32,900 when purchased through a dealership, but that assumes
excellent condition, which I don&rsquo;t think the car <em>quite</em> qualifies for given the
minor cosmetic damage to the interior and the fact that some of the tires are at
less than 75% tread depth. The private party Blue Book value given those facts
is currently $30,000. Ultimately I paid $31,000, which given dealership markup
seemed reasonable at the time.</p>

<p>I spent quite a long time negotiating with Ken, so I want to take some time to
describe his personality and style as a salesperson. I can&rsquo;t help but view him
as a reasonably nice guy. He seemed to be friendly and in possession of a good
sense of humour, and was very patient with my less than stellar manual driving.
That said, he was subtly pushing me to spend more than I wanted to, and he gave
me misinformation and made statements of dubious veracity in several instances
(I hesitate to say &ldquo;lied&rdquo;).  For instance, when I told him I didn&rsquo;t <em>need</em> a new
car and that I could just as easily walk away, he repeatedly emphasized that the
STI was &ldquo;a hot item&rdquo; and that if I left and came back tomorrow, it might not
still be on the lot.  This is kind of true under the right circumstances, but I
had been looking at Craigslist and AutoTrader for months at this point, and I
knew that this car in particular had been sitting on their lot for at least a
month&mdash;maybe more like two months.  That fact was also ascertainable from
some of the paperwork Ken gave me on the vehicle, so it was a pretty poor
attempt to mislead me.</p>

<p>I also happened to notice that the price on Craigslist had dropped something
like $50 between the night before and the day I was there, so I called him on
that as well. He changed his story at that point and told me how the STI is a
performance car for a particular type of buyer, and not just anyone would be
looking for one, to which I replied: yeah, that&rsquo;s my point!  It&rsquo;s a sought-after
car but it&rsquo;s also not something just anyone is going to drop in and buy, so I
know you can&rsquo;t sell it as quickly as you say you can.</p>

<p>While Ken repeatedly insisted that he was on my side and wanted to work with me
to get me the best deal possible, and that he wasn&rsquo;t a typical pushy sales guy,
I&rsquo;d also describe his tactics as emotionally manipulative.  During the
negotiation whenever I requested something and he went and talked to his manager
and came back with a not-quite-good-enough offer, he&rsquo;d walk back to the desk
languidly with his head hung in faux-exhaustion, and say with an exasperated
sigh that he just couldn&rsquo;t make it work or something along those lines.  The
friend I&rsquo;d come with told me at one point that he was using tricks specifically
tailored to work on my personality type, which I think is probably an accurate
assessment because even though I knew what he was doing, I think there was a
subconscious element of feeling bad for the guy and wanting to work with him for
that reason.</p>

<p>After the initial negotiation we ended up agreeing on $30,800, conditional on me
being able to take the car to an independent mechanic for an inspection. I am
about as mechanically adept as Jeremy Clarkson, but without the benefit of his
encyclopedic knowledge of cars.  For that reason, I hadn&rsquo;t even bothered to look
under the hood, and it was important to me to get the car checked out
independently to verify its condition.</p>

<p>The process got a little strange at this point. I wanted to write above that we
verbally agreed on $30,800, but that&rsquo;s not quite accurate.  Ken and I would
agree on something and he&rsquo;d write down the offer on paper and make a crude &ldquo;sign
here&rdquo; line and ask me to initial it.  Even though I knew his handwritten offer
couldn&rsquo;t possibly be legally binding, and he assured me of as much, I was a bit
hesitant to do this as it just gave me a bad vibe.  But he refused to proceed
unless I&rsquo;d initial his paper, so I did.  He took that to his manager and finally
we were able to come to an agreement.</p>

<p>I got a temporary permit to drive the car and took it to
<a href="http://www.communityautomotiveservice.net/">Community Automotive Service</a>
in Burien, which, strangely, seems to be one of very few mechanics in the area
south of Seattle. I paid around $80 for the mechanic there to do a quick
examination of the car. He pulled the ODBII codes, checked the brakes, fluid
levels, etc, and took the car for a short test drive, among other things.  When
I came back to pick it up he told me that overall it was in great condition, but
it seemed that the 30,000 mile maintenance had never been done.  That was pretty
alarming to me as the car was at approximately 33,500 miles at that point,
meaning it was 3,500 miles overdue for some fairly important maintenance. I
expected the dealership to have done that maintenance as part of the trade in process
and factored the cost into the price they paid for the car; as far as I&rsquo;m
concerned, one shouldn&rsquo;t even be taking the car on test drives when it&rsquo;s 3,500
miles overdue for maintenance.  I got antsy when my Civic was a couple hundred
kilometres overdue for an oil change, and an STI has considerably more power
with which to rip itself apart if it&rsquo;s not kept in good condition. In retrospect
I think that alone should have been enough to make me go look elsewhere, but I
had already spent probably 4-5 hours at this point between the test drive and
the negotiating. I didn&rsquo;t want all of that time to be for nothing.</p>

<p>To be specific, the mechanic at Community Automotive said that a number of the
car&rsquo;s fluids needed to be flushed, that the air and fuel filters needed to be
replaced, that the brake pads would need to be replaced within a few months, and
that it would need new tires in the not-too-distant future.  His statement about
the tires turned out to be questionable as I later found out that they do all
still have more than 50% tread depth remaining, but the rest of his findings
seem to have been accurate. He also gave me a printout of the ODBII history.
There were a few error codes (abnormal clutch signal, power supply voltage
failure, excessive variation from steering position sensor, and right-hand
curtain airbag control module failure), but they were from the past and not
reproducible so he said he didn&rsquo;t feel that they were anything to worry about.
Overall, he told me that he liked the car and thought it was in great shape
except for the maintenance that needed to be done.  He thought the price I&rsquo;d
agreed on was a bit high, but I don&rsquo;t think he was aware of how high the Blue
Book value for the vehicle was, because he seemed surprised when I told him that
as well.</p>

<p>I went back to the dealership and began hours more of painful negotiation.
Given the issues that the mechanic had identified I was not willing to pay
$30,800 unless the dealership would fix some of them.  They were very reluctant
to budge on this and in the end I gave in more than I probably should have.  I
talked to both Ken and his manager, and both were incredulous about the report
that the mechanic had given me; they didn&rsquo;t feel that most of the items were
real issues.  I very clearly recall Ken&rsquo;s manager,
<a href="http://www.dealerrater.com/sales/Jan-Rac-review-136803">Jan Rac</a>,
giving me a spiel about how Walker&rsquo;s Renton Subaru had well-qualified
technicians, how they had a reputation to uphold, and how they had the only &ldquo;STI
tech&rdquo; in the area and that nobody else is allowed to work on STIs.  I thought at
the time that much of this was probably a huge load of bullshit, and in
retrospect it <em>almost certainly</em> is.  As far as I can tell there is no such
thing as an &ldquo;STI tech.&rdquo; Nissan has something like that for GT-Rs, but that&rsquo;s a
$100,000 car.  I cannot find any reference, anywhere, to any such thing as an
&ldquo;STI tech.&rdquo;  I do not like being lied to.</p>

<p>Ken, who had previously been absolutely fine with me taking the car to an
independent mechanic and was convinced that I wouldn&rsquo;t find any issues,
exasperatedly told me how independent mechanics never say anything good about
cars; they&rsquo;re only looking for problems (yes, that&rsquo;s <em>exactly the point</em>) and
implied that the guy I&rsquo;d taken it to was just looking to cash in&hellip;  even after
my wife and I<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> repeatedly told him that we had no affiliation with that
mechanic and that the mechanic knew that we would not be taking the car back to
him for repairs. We negotiated more and finally agreed to them replacing the
brake pads and doing some of the fluid flushes in exchange for bumping the sale
price up to $31,000 (because the brake pad replacement alone cost almost $600
since the STI uses Brembo pads).  It terms of the maintenance they offered, it
wasn&rsquo;t that great a deal for me, and as I mentioned earlier, in retrospect I
really should have just walked at this point. In fact I almost did over a
miscommunication about the brake pad replacement: I wanted all of them replaced,
but Ken had assumed I meant only one pair and had neglected to ask <em>which</em> pair.
I had been at the dealership literally all day at this point; I was there for at
least ten hours, and I really wanted to close the deal just so it wouldn&rsquo;t be a
huge waste of time.  Nevertheless I told them it was all of the brake pads or I
was leaving, and after some pageantry about confirming the offer with the sales
manager (who had already left at this point), we finally reached an agreement.</p>

<p>I added on some extras as well, including 3M protection for the front of the
vehicle for around $600, and an extended warranty for around $2000. Including
taxes, the total cost was around $38,000.</p>

<h2>Foreshadowing</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where things get <em>really</em> shady.  I left the car at the dealership to
have the service done so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to drive back to Renton for it (which
is a 30 minute to one hour drive from where I live in Redmond, depending on
traffic).  When I came back to pick up the car, I went to the service desk to
get the keys and request a copy of the service history and schedule so that I
would have it for my records (and to verify that they actually did the work).
The service advisor I talked to, whose name I think is Kay, asked me if I was
aware that the car had been in an accident and had had about $4,000 worth of
bodywork done. My heart leapt into my throat at this revelation, and I said that
no, I did <em>not</em> know that, and in fact I had been told that the car had <em>not</em>
been in any accidents.  She got an &ldquo;oh shit&rdquo; kind of look on her face and then
said she&rsquo;d double check, and after a bit of typing told me that actually she&rsquo;d
just typed the VIN in wrong, and that this car was fine.</p>

<p>This is what those of a literary predilection might call foreshadowing.</p>

<p>I was too relieved to really think too much of it at the time, and anyway the
contract had already been signed at this point, but knowing what I do now this
is obviously <em>hugely</em> suspicious.  Kay strikes me as a nice person, and I mean
genuinely nice rather than in a salesperson sort of way where niceness is
necessitated as a means of being persuasive.  I really want to believe that she
actually did just type in the wrong VIN and wasn&rsquo;t lying to me.  But&hellip; well,
let&rsquo;s do some math.</p>

<p>A VIN is 17 alphanumeric characters long, and each character has certain
restrictions on what it can be.  That means that there are 6.5273512 &times;
10<sup>25</sup> possible VINs.  That is a very, very large number.  VINs have
been in use since 1954, and the number of cars in the world just surpassed one
billion in 2011, but I think the source I got that from was only referring to
cars currently on the road.  So I think it&rsquo;s generous to assume that there have
been 10 billion cars with VINs since 1954.  Now, I was never very good at
statistics so this calculation is probably inaccurate for a host of reasons, but
by my math that means that if you type an arbitrary wrong digit when entering a
VIN, you have a 1.532015 &times; 10<sup>-16</sup> chance of getting a vehicle
that actually <em>exists.</em>  By way of comparison, that is 8 orders of magnitude
more unlikely than getting six of six numbers on the 6/49<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know all the details of how VINs really work; they&rsquo;re definitely not
uniformly distributed, and as I said, I was never very good at statistics
anyway.  So let&rsquo;s make this a little simpler.  The last six digits of a VIN are
sequential, and to the best of my knowledge, if all the other digits are fixed
then then all of the possibilities afforded by those last six digits should
refer to the same model of car, for the same model year, made by the same plant.
In North America the last five digits must be numeric, but since STIs are
manufactured in Japan, I think that gives us 33<sup>6</sup> possibilities
(because some characters are excluded), which is 1,291,467,969.  So again, the
possibility of typing a wrong digit in an arbitrary position and getting a car
that actually exists is very low.  But even assuming that she managed to do
that, I&rsquo;m fairly certain their service records only show cars that have actually
come to <em>that dealership</em> for service.</p>

<p><em>So how the fuck could she have possibly happened upon the same car, that came
to their dealership and got work done for an accident which probably would have
cost a similar amount to fix to the one my car was in, by typing in the wrong
VIN?</em> If anyone has a plausible explanation for this please do let me know, but
I just cannot believe that that really happened unless I have <em>incredible</em> bad
luck.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, I didn&rsquo;t think too much of what Kay said at the time. I got the car; the brakes had been
replaced; things seemed fine.  Ken told me that the difference with the new
brakes was really noticeable and that he was glad they got that done for me.
I couldn&rsquo;t help but think &ldquo;Oh, you mean the same brake pads you and your manager
were telling me <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> need to be replaced when I bought the car from you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 3M service hadn&rsquo;t been done yet as it had to be scheduled in advance.  I
ended up waiting until the 8th of April to get that done.  When I dropped the
car off for that, I asked Kay to check if they had actually done the fluid
flushes they were supposed to, as the service record I&rsquo;d received from the last
time I picked the car up only indicated the brake replacement.  I hadn&rsquo;t noticed
that at the time because my mind was on the supposed accident damage that she
told me about.  She checked and sure enough they had <em>not</em> done the fluid
flushes, which they were contractually obligated to do.  She said that they&rsquo;d
get it done with the 3M service, and indeed they did (or at least they gave me a
service record indicating such&mdash;I don&rsquo;t really have the expertise to check
myself).  I wondered if they neglected to do this the first time on purpose,
hoping that I just wouldn&rsquo;t notice.  When I picked up the car the next time, Kay
told me she was really glad that they had done the rear differential fluid
flush, as the fluid had been <em>very</em> overdue for a change.  I think the word she
used to describe it was &ldquo;pudding&rdquo; or &ldquo;sludge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Recall that this is the maintenance they told me their world-class technicians
hadn&rsquo;t felt it necessary to do. I&rsquo;m sure you can understand that my attitude at this
point was <strong>fuck these guys.</strong></p>

<h2>The Short-lived Honeymoon</h2>

<p>Finally, I had the car and all the service was done, and I was overjoyed. It was
a ton of fun to drive, and I quickly (in my opinion, anyway) became more adept
at driving a manual. I bought floor mats and Rally Armor mudflaps, which I
installed myself. My new car put a smile on my face every day; even the short
commute to work was a joy.</p>

<p>But I noticed a couple problems. First I noticed that the heated seat bottom on
the driver&rsquo;s side didn&rsquo;t work.  The back worked, but the bottom didn&rsquo;t get warm
at all.  I was annoyed that I hadn&rsquo;t noticed it during the test drive, but it
would be covered by the warranty, so I didn&rsquo;t consider it a big issue. Then, on
the 27th of April, my wife and I went to central Washington to escape the rain
and go hiking.  In contrast to the Seattle area, it was very warm in central
Washington that day, and the interior of the car was boiling from sitting in the
sun when we got back from our first hike of the day.  I turned on the air
conditioning and&hellip;  it was clearly not as cold as it should be.  It was no
colder than the regular air coming in from the exterior. This was even more
bothersome than the heated seat issue, but again I figured that it could be
fixed under warranty, so I didn&rsquo;t worry about it too much.</p>

<p>During the next week I also replaced the air filter (by myself, which I was
pretty proud of, even though it&rsquo;s about the easiest thing to change on a car)
and noticed that the air box had a large crack in it, and that the air intake
duct which goes into the air box had been broken in half height-wise and
shoddily glued back together with some kind of sealant.  I still didn&rsquo;t think
much of it at this point as I figured someone had damaged them while replacing
the air filter previously.</p>

<p>Finally, I booked a service appointment for May 3rd to get the heated seat and
air conditioning fixed at
<a href="http://www.eastsidesubaru.com/index.htm">Eastside Subaru</a> in Kirkland, which
is a lot closer to Redmond than Renton is.  I dropped the car off and they
called me back later in the day to inform me that they verified both of the
issues, but that while the heated seat problem could be fixed under warranty,
the air conditioner couldn&rsquo;t because the condenser had been
<strong>damaged in an accident.</strong></p>

<p>Ugh.</p>

<p>I went back to Eastside Subaru and asked them to point out how they knew it was
accident damage, since Walker&rsquo;s had told me the car had not been in an accident.
The technician who serviced the car came out and pointed out several things to
me.  The tubes from the AC condenser were bent in such a way that it was obvious
to him that there had been an impact, and they leaked badly. Moreover, the
condenser itself was quite obviously bent.  There are tool marks on the bolts
that hold on both of the front quarter panels, indicating that they&rsquo;ve been
removed to be repaired or replaced.  There&rsquo;s an AC recharge sticker on the
inside of the hood which appears to have been glued on, not very well, so it&rsquo;s
peeling off; I believe the technician also said that he thought the whole hood
had likely been replaced.  The power steering fluid reservoir attaches to the
body of the vehicle in two places and one of those was cracked. The radiator
support bar is also bent. It&rsquo;s slight enough that the untrained eye would
probably not notice it, but the technician at Eastside told me, and I am very
confident that these were his exact words<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, that Walker&rsquo;s &ldquo;had to have
known&rdquo; that the vehicle was in an accident.</p>

<p>I drove back down to Renton and spent probably about half an hour yelling at
various people.  Ken tried to placate me in various ways; he told me that they
didn&rsquo;t know and that they couldn&rsquo;t have known; he mentioned that &ldquo;my guy&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t
notice the problem either; he tried to tell me that this wouldn&rsquo;t actually
decrease the resale value of the car (bullshit) and that since it&rsquo;s not on the
CarFax or title no one needs to know anyway. He made repeated use of euphemisms
implying that maybe there <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> actually any damage and the car <em>hadn&rsquo;t</em>
actually been in an accident, even after I <em>showed him</em> the damaged parts. He
seemed to be acting almost as though if I simply willed it hard enough I could
bring about some alternate reality wherein my car was pristine and undamaged.
(Believe me, I tried.) This, to me, emphasizes the problem with people like Ken
and his manager and, as I&rsquo;ll soon describe, his manager&rsquo;s manager&mdash;that is
to say, salespeople&mdash;they have an atypical understanding of the concepts of
<em>facts</em> and <em>truth</em> and act as though reality is open to interpretation.</p>

<p>I told Ken that I refuse to lie to someone when I sell the car (and let this
post be a testament to that, because it is now public knowledge, whether or not
it ever shows up on the CarFax) and that I felt that I was probably out
thousands of dollars in resale value, not to mention the fact that I have no
idea what kind of mechanical issues this could result in down the road. My
confidence in my extended warranty has also gone down the drain, because if
anything fails and can be shown to have signs of accident damage, even if it&rsquo;s
very minor, then it won&rsquo;t be covered.</p>

<p>I made it clear that I wanted them to take the car back and refund me the entire
purchase price including the extended warranty, 3M treatment, and taxes I paid.
That didn&rsquo;t even account for the hundreds of dollars I had already put into the
car (mud flaps, floor mats, air filter, etc); I didn&rsquo;t care, I just wanted to
cancel the transaction and be done with it.  We argued for a while, but it was
fairly late on Friday afternoon and he told me that there was no one at the
dealership who could make that decision at that time. He said that he&rsquo;d get the
general manger to call me back the next day before noon. I asked him to tell the
GM that I would be talking to an attorney if I didn&rsquo;t get the answer I wanted,
and left. From this point until the beginning of June, I completely stopped
driving the car, as I wanted to ensure the strength of my case by minimizing the
number of miles I put on the car.</p>

<p>That Saturday I had plans to go hiking, and I didn&rsquo;t want to cancel them just
for a phone call that probably wouldn&rsquo;t go anywhere, so I called the dealership
early in the morning.  Ken wasn&rsquo;t there yet, but I left a message for him saying
that I may not be available to answer the phone but that he could leave me a
message.  Nobody called me on Saturday, and in fact I haven&rsquo;t spoken to Ken at
all since that Friday, the 3rd of May.  On Monday, the 7th of May, I called back
and asked to speak to the general manager,
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/james-capestany/11/b84/772">James Capestany</a>.  I
ended up having more or less the same conversation with him that I had with Ken.
He was and is adamant that the dealership didn&rsquo;t know that the car was in an
accident, and further, that it&rsquo;s not their responsibility to know.  He pointed
out that the salespeople do not have mechanical qualifications.  I asked him why
his <em>technicians</em> failed to thoroughly inspect a car which costs upwards of
$30,000 when they took it as a trade-in.  He gave me a completely unsatisfactory
answer which I don&rsquo;t quite recall.  I told him that I had read the sale
contract, including the provision for trade-ins which states that the party
trading in the car warrants that it has not had any undisclosed damage requiring
bodywork, and asked why he was screwing me instead of taking the car back and
going after the person who clearly violated that contract when he traded it in.
I don&rsquo;t recall his answer to this question either, except insofar as it also
being unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>As Ken did, the James tried to convince me that the accident wouldn&rsquo;t affect the
resale value of the car that badly.  I said that if he were confident that that
was the case, he should have no problem with me getting it appraised by another
Subaru dealership and then having Walker&rsquo;s compensate me for the difference in
value.  He replied, somewhat angrily I think, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not gonna do that.&rdquo;  I
told him that I held the dealership responsible for their failure to thoroughly
inspect the car, and that I would be talking to a lawyer if they wouldn&rsquo;t refund
me or at least compensate me for the depreciation.  He stated that I could talk
to a lawyer if I wanted to, but that the
<a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.70.180">RCW (i.e. state law) on the matter</a>
states that they are only liable if they don&rsquo;t disclose damage that they know
about, and he reiterated that they did not know.</p>

<p>Even to this date, I am unsure of whether or I believe that. I am a firm
believer in Hanlon&rsquo;s razor (&ldquo;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately
explained by stupidity&rdquo;), but the odds I calculated above make me incredulous
that Kay didn&rsquo;t actually have some record of the accident, in which case they
obviously would have to have known. The dealership has shown me, as &ldquo;proof&rdquo; that
they didn&rsquo;t know, copies of reports run in December of 2012 which indicated that
the car had a clean record. But still, I&rsquo;m incredulous that <em>nobody</em> noticed
the damage before I took the car to Eastside Subaru. The technicians at Walker&rsquo;s
should have done a thorough inspection as Ken and Jan assured me they did, so
either someone lied about the damage, or their technicians neglected to do their
duty, or they are incompetent. And what of the other customers who must have
looked at the vehicle before I did? When I was selling my Civic after I bought
the STI, two of the three people who test drove it had some mechanical
experience and identified some potential issues with the vehicle that I wasn&rsquo;t
aware of. Did nobody more knowledgeable than I look at this STI and notice the
damaged parts?</p>

<p>Either way, I told James that I would be talking to a lawyer.  He told me that
he&rsquo;d try to get in touch with the previous owner of the vehicle, and that he&rsquo;d
pull up the repair order from when it was first traded in to see if they had any
indication that the car may have been in an accident. Ultimately he wasn&rsquo;t able
to get in touch with the previous owner, but I&rsquo;m not sure what difference it
would have made. If that guy had any common sense whatsoever, he would have lied
about the accident since knowingly trading the car in without disclosing the
accident is a violation of the trade in contract.  And even if he had told the
truth, what then? Would Walker&rsquo;s have sued him if <em>he</em> refused to compensate me?
I doubt it.</p>

<p>Later that same day, James called back. He asked me to explain again what
Eastside Subaru told me about the air conditioning.  When I mentioned that they
said they couldn&rsquo;t warranty the part because of accident damage, he said that
that&rsquo;s not true and he didn&rsquo;t know why they&rsquo;d say that.  He said that they just
changed management and probably didn&rsquo;t know what they were doing, and that
Walker&rsquo;s has been in business for 25 years.  He told me if I brought the car
down he would replace the AC condenser under warranty.  I told him that that was
not my primary concern and that it wouldn&rsquo;t be good enough.  He accepted that,
but pointed out that I still needed to get the AC fixed and that he could have
it done under warranty.</p>

<p>Obviously what James told me about the condenser being replaceable under
warranty was not true. I looked it up after I got off that call and
this is what the Subaru warranty says:</p>

<blockquote><p>These warranties do not cover any part
which malfunctions, fails or is damaged due to objects striking the vehicle,
road hazards, whether on or off the road, <strong>accident</strong>, fire, neglect, abuse or
any other cause beyond the control of [Subaru of America].</p></blockquote>

<p>(Emphasis mine.) This is obviously exactly what I expected since no warranty
ever in the history of automobiles, as far as I can fathom, has covered accident
damage.  Otherwise there would be no reason for any type of insurance other than
liability insurance. When I talked to him next I asked James to explain this
discrepancy, and he said that while &ldquo;the letter of&rdquo; the warranty agreement said
one thing, it was open to interpretation and it was a matter of customer service
and reputation to do warranty replacements in situations like this.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m splitting hairs at this point, but what James was offering was <em>not a
warranty replacement</em>, and I know that for a fact because as part of the
eventual resolution of this nightmare, I did get Walker&rsquo;s to replace the
AC condenser, and the amount charged is listed as &ldquo;Internal&rdquo; rather than
&ldquo;Warranty&rdquo; on the service record. I do think the distinction is important
because it means that the dealership, rather than Subaru of America, is paying
for the new part, and it&rsquo;s not a cheap part. Although offering to replace the
condenser is not an admission of <em>legal</em> liability, he obviously would not offer
it if he truly felt that his shop was guiltless in this, because the repair
comes out of his bottom line. So again, he&rsquo;s <strong>directly lying to me,</strong> and
throwing Eastside Subaru under the bus at the same time.</p>

<p>I readily admit to being a bit naïve in some respects, but it&rsquo;s still shocking
to me that there are people who will do that.</p>

<h2>Lawyer Up</h2>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t bluffing about talking to a lawyer. I have a group legal plan through
work which covers all my legal fees for applicable issues, which include
consumer protection cases. Unfortunately there is also a downside to the group
legal plan: it somewhat limits one&rsquo;s choice of lawyer, and even among the
limited selection of in-network lawyers within a reasonable distance, many are
very busy. Thus, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that you&rsquo;ll get a <em>good</em> lawyer.</p>

<p>I do not think that I got a good lawyer.</p>

<p>I had to call several lawyers before I was able to find one who would take on
the case. One of the lawyers who called me back but couldn&rsquo;t take the case was
kind enough to provide me with some basic information.  He said that he thought
I had a good case under the Washington state consumer protection law.  He said
that the dealership&rsquo;s failure to thoroughly inspect the car before selling it
and claiming it had not been in an accident could be considered an unlawful
&ldquo;deceptive act&rdquo; under
<a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=19.86.020">RCW 19.86.020</a>.
He also pointed out that the Consumer Protection Act allows for triple damages
up to a maximum of $25,000, which might have been useful leverage in my
discussions with James, but I never actually mentioned it to him  because the
lawyer who eventually took on the case didn&rsquo;t think much of its applicability.</p>

<p>In fact, the lawyer I did eventually end up hiring didn&rsquo;t initially think that I
had a case at all (but didn&rsquo;t tell me this until I had already hired her). She
was essentially in agreement with James that the dealership would only be liable
if they knew about the accident before selling the car to me, and since we would
likely not be able to prove that even if it were true<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>, we would
have no case.</p>

<p>I did some research of my own and discovered a few other laws which might be
applicable. I won&rsquo;t bother mentioning all of them, but I felt that the strongest
was the
<a href="http://www.atg.wa.gov/ConsumerIssues/Cars/UsedCars.aspx#implied_warranty">Implied Warranty of Merchantability</a>.
My understanding is that this state law applies to consumer goods in general,
but as it relates to cars in particular, it states that vehicles sold by
dealerships &ldquo;must be fit for ordinary driving purposes, free of major
defects, reasonably safe, <strong>and of the average quality of similar vehicles
available for sale in that price range.</strong>&rdquo; (Emphasis mine.) In my opinion, given
the depreciation and damaged components, my car obviously did not meet those
standards, but my lawyer still felt that it would be an uphill battle. And of
course, even if I prevailed in arbitration or court, there would be no guarantee
that the dealership would be required to offer anything beyond repairing the AC
condenser.</p>

<p>My lawyer agreed to write a letter to the dealership on my behalf, and that if
they did not respond favourably, we could take them to arbitration. I sent her
all of the documents necessary for the letter on May 15th, and followed up on
May 20th to check on her progress. She told me that she would be working
on the letter soon. I sent her another email on the 24th, but didn&rsquo;t hear back
from her until the 7th of June when I let her know that I would no longer need
her services. Good help is hard to find.</p>

<h2>Resolution</h2>

<p>Luckily lawyers are not the only means of gaining leverage against corporations.
I also contacted <a href="http://www.king5.com/news/get-jesse">Jesse Jones</a> of King 5
News, and filed complaints with Subaru of America, the Better Business Bureau,
and the Washington State Attorney General&rsquo;s office. I didn&rsquo;t get a call back
from Jesse, but the other three seem to have had an effect. I exchanged several
emails with a representative from Subaru who contacted the dealership on my
behalf to try to mediate a resolution. The representative didn&rsquo;t seem to have
much actual power over the dealership, but she was courteous and timely, seemed
sympathetic to my concerns, and made a real effort to do what she could, so I
certainly appreciate that.</p>

<p>The complaint to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office seemed to have more of an effect.
Not long after Walker&rsquo;s received it, James called me back and offered to write
me a cheque to cover some of the depreciation in addition to fixing the air
conditioner, as long as I would sign a document releasing the dealership from
all liability relating to the matter. Given that I had been fighting with the
dealership for a month and that my lawyer had gone <acronym title="Away WithOut
Leave"> AWOL</acronym>, I readily accepted this offer.</p>

<p>I took the car back to Eastside Subaru to determine what the depreciation would
actually be. Given the lack of mechanical damage, the absence of records of the
accident, the fact that the damage was almost completely repaired, and the
rarity of the STI sedan, I was told that the depreciation would probably not be
more than $1,000 to $1,500. This seemed low to me, but I discussed it with a
friend who is very knowledgeable about cars and he felt that it was not
unreasonable. If you disagree with this, please <strong>do not</strong> tell me, because at
this point I don&rsquo;t want to know. (Ignorance is bliss.) I took the car back to
Walker&rsquo;s on the 4th of June, and they ended up fixing the AC condenser and air
intake duct and giving me a cheque for $1,000.</p>

<p>In the interest of fairness I will say that I did have a fairly positive
experience at the Walker&rsquo;s Renton Subaru service department when I took my
vehicle in for the repairs. The service advisor I dealt with,
<a href="http://www.dealerrater.com/sales/Brad-Hallock-review-33465/">Brad Hallock</a>, was
very courteous and helpful. Of course, that doesn&rsquo;t come close to excusing the
rest of my experience with the dealership, particularly given that it was the
Walker&rsquo;s Renton Subaru service technicians who ostensibly inspected the vehicle
when they bought it.  While I was picking up my car after the service was
finished, I overheard another service advisor talking about the &ldquo;world class
inspection&rdquo; that they were going to do for another customer. I was tempted to
interrupt and tell the customer about my experience with their &ldquo;world class
inspection,&rdquo; but to my shame, I&rsquo;m too non-confrontational to do something like
that. It&rsquo;s a flaw that I need to work on.</p>

<p>I am fairly satisfied with the compensation I received, and overjoyed to be able
to put this ordeal behind me. At this point I consider the matter to be closed.
The Attorney General&rsquo;s office has closed their file on the case, and as soon as
Walker&rsquo;s responds to the Better Business Bureau complaint, I will close that as
well. I am looking forward to never having any contact with them again.</p>

<p>That said, I am absolutely not satisfied with how the dealership handled the
issue in the month between my discovering the problem and them finally giving me
some compensation. (Otherwise I would not be writing this, of course.) I spent
far too much time fighting with them. At every juncture I encountered
dishonesty, self-interest, and a complete refusal to accept responsibility for
the failure of their technicians to thoroughly inspect the car. Between
the time I spent playing telephone tag with the general manager, the time to
find and hire a lawyer, the time spent on filing complaints with third parties,
and the disruption of my schedule resulting from the loss of use of my vehicle
for nearly a month<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, I probably wasted more than a dozen hours on this,
and it certainly impacted my productivity at work as well.</p>

<p>When I was buying the car, Ken and Jan repeatedly assured me of the quality of
Walker&rsquo;s inspections and servicing, and the qualifications of their technicians.
When it turned out that those technicians had missed significant accident damage
which was still present on the vehicle and should have been easily discoverable
by a qualified technician, nobody at the dealership would stand behind those
claims of excellence; they repeatedly insisted that they could not have known
and were not responsible. I find this appalling, though I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t find
it shocking. When I asked why they would take such an expensive vehicle as a
trade-in without doing a thorough inspection, I was told that since the CarFax
didn&rsquo;t indicate any problems, they had no reason to suspect that there would be
anything wrong with the vehicle.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why I had to fight with the dealership about this <em>at all</em>.
They should have just refunded the sale completely as soon as I raised the issue
with them, and gone after the original owner to recoup their losses, who was
<em>clearly</em> in violation of his sale contract.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>I hope this doesn&rsquo;t sound histrionic, because it is completely genuine, but I
was also emotionally affected by all of this. I tend to be very trusting and
give people the benefit of the doubt with respect to their motivations. I am
ill-equipped to deal with salespeople because I am not naturally inclined to
assume that someone will mislead me and take advantage of me out of
self-interest. I expect cold, detached, exploitative behaviour from large
corporations, but Walker&rsquo;s really isn&rsquo;t that large, and these were <em>real people</em>
with whom I had face-to-face conversations, who had the power to do the right
thing but were unwilling to. The whole experience has made me more cynical.
Moreover, the feeling I hate more than any other is powerlessness, and I found
it simultaneously frustrating and discouraging to be in a situation where for a
long time I seemed to have practically no recourse against the dealership for
the losses I&rsquo;d suffered due to their incompetence.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll never again enjoy my car as much I did for the first two months I owned it,
and although I&rsquo;ve been reassured that Subarus are built like tanks, I&rsquo;m not
sure I&rsquo;ll be able to completely get past the paranoia that every tiny creak or
shudder might be forewarning of some impending catastrophic failure. But on the
bright side, I do still love the car. I was worried that I&rsquo;d hate it after all
of this because of the negative associations with all the time I wasted and
frustration I experienced, but that isn&rsquo;t the case. It&rsquo;s still a ton of fun to
drive. I&rsquo;m looking forward to finally taking it on its inaugural road trip, to
modding it and making it my own, and to spending many hours &ldquo;going Subaruing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, with every negative experience comes the silver lining of life lessons to be
learned, and this is no different. Here are my takeaways from this:</p>

<ul>
<li>A clean record from CarFax and other similar services is completely
meaningless. Anything not reported to insurance or the police will not show
up on a CarFax report, and in my case, I have reason to believe that an
insurance claim and police report <em>were</em> made for the accident my vehicle
was in, and CarFax <em>still</em> shows nothing<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Mechanics can be similarly unreliable. Ideally one should have a trusted
mechanic whom they&rsquo;ve dealt with previously. I haven&rsquo;t lived in Washginton
long enough to know any mechanics well, so I should have asked friends who
are knowledgeable about cars for recommendations instead of just picking one
based on Yelp reviews.</li>
<li>Even if you don&rsquo;t know much about cars, there are certain things you can
look for under the hood when buying a used car which may indicate that the
vehicle was in an accident or had bodywork done. Check for tool marks (i.e.
missing paint) on the bolts under the hood. Check for damaged plastic
components. Some vehicles (although I don&rsquo;t think mine is among them,
unfortunately) have the VIN stamped on major components; if any of the VINs
are missing or don&rsquo;t match, something is up.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not sure if this is a fair generalization based on this one experience,
but if I were to buy another used car I would be very suspicious of vehicles
which are overdue for important maintenance, as it may indicate that the
seller did not thoroughly inspect the vehicle or does not care to maintain
it himself.</li>
<li>I am by no means an expert negotiator so take this with a grain of salt as
well, but I suspect that immediate face-to-face negotiation is not the best
way to go. It suggests a desire to buy a vehicle quickly, and the more time
one spends negotiating, the less willing one will be to walk away due to the
lost investment of time. It is probably better to tell the dealership what
you are willing to pay and immediately leave if they won&rsquo;t meet that demand.
Either they&rsquo;ll call you back with a good offer, or you can continue to look
elsewhere.</li>
<li>Buying a new car means suffering immediate depreciation, but it&rsquo;s also much
less likely to result in nasty surprises like this. Many states have lemon
laws to protect new car buyers from troublesome cars, but these rarely apply
to used cars. Consider whether this tradeoff is worthwhile. Personally, I&rsquo;ll
definitely be looking at new cars next time I buy a vehicle.</li>
<li>And most importantly, when legal options don&rsquo;t pan out, the best way to get
what you want from a corporation may simply be to be persistent and annoying
enough that it becomes worth their money to solve your issue just to make
you go away.</li>
</ul>

<p>The STI is only available with a six-speed manual transmission, but I was specifically looking for a manual car anyway. One might wonder why I&rsquo;d seek out a manual even when I hardly knew how to drive them.  The answer is that I&rsquo;d always been intrigued by manual transmissions, and after taking a quick lesson I was set on buying a manual because I found it to be a lot of fun. Plus, without simply jumping in and buying a manual car, one has limited opportunity to learn&mdash;you can only spend so much time borrowing friends&#8217; vehicles, and lessons are expensive.  (For those of you outside of North America, manuals are fairly rare here, accounting for less than 7% of yearly sales. They can&rsquo;t be rented at all because most people, particularly younger people, don&rsquo;t know how to drive them, so the rental companies would be constantly replacing burnt-out clutches and ground up gears if they did offer manual vehicles.) Unfortunately, being inexperienced at driving manual may have influenced me to make the purchase faster than I otherwise might have, as it&rsquo;s embarrassing to go on a test drive and stall the car several times, and I was worried that if I couldn&rsquo;t borrow a car to practice before subsequent test drives I&rsquo;d do an even worse job of it.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

    <updated>2012-11-14T22:58:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2012/11/14/photo-app-progress-update</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In September I <a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2012/09/14/social-networks-and-content-ownership/">wrote about</a>
my intention to develop a web application to share my photos. I made good
progress on it throughout September and early October, but for various reasons I
haven&rsquo;t been able to work on it much in the past month or so. Last weekend,
though, I was able to solve some blocking issues which were preventing me from
doing an alpha release. Those being dealt with, I&rsquo;ve now got a few of my albums
up at <a href="http://photos.mlindgren.ca/">photos.mlindgren.ca</a>; take a look and leave
a comment if you have any feedback.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t released the source code yet as there&rsquo;s still a great deal of work to
be done, and I&rsquo;m generally of the belief that dumping a bunch of unfinished,
messy code on Github with the hope that the community will sort it out is of
little benefit to anyone. My goal at this point is to do a beta release in a
two to three months or so and release the code at that point. That timeline is
anything but firm, though. This project is turning out to be much more work than
I expected (as projects are wont to do), and I expect to be fairly busy over the
next couple months.</p>

<p>Anyway, with the alpha version up and running, this seems like a good
opportunity to reflect on some of the issues I&rsquo;ve faced that complicated the
project, and on what remains to be done. <!-- more --></p>

<h2>Wand and the OOM Killer</h2>

<p>I mentioned in my
<a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2012/09/14/the-state-of-python-imaging/">post on Python imaging libraries</a>
that I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://dahlia.kr/wand/index.html">Wand</a> to resize and transform
uploaded photos. It&rsquo;s very convenient and easy to use, and from a
maintainability and ease of use perspective I much prefer using Python bindings
for ImageMagick to shelling out to the ImageMagick executable. One
of my goals for this project is that other people should be able to install it
on their own servers with relative ease, and I suspect relying on ImageMagick
executables for image processing would lead to cross-platform and configuration
issues.</p>

<p>But, Wand is not yet a mature library and it has some significant issues of its
own. First and foremost, when I started using it it had some major memory
leaks. I found and fixed more than 10 leaks and submitted a pull request which
was merged into the main repository&mdash;however, there hasn&rsquo;t yet been an
official release including my fixes yet, so pip installs and downloads from the
Wand website will still include those leaks.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I got all of the leaks or if more still remain. The ones I fixed
were discovered mostly through ad-hoc testing and reading the code. I&rsquo;ve been
running my app for several days now and the memory consumption when it&rsquo;s idle
has stayed flat, so I believe I&rsquo;ve removed at least the most common leaks, but I
haven&rsquo;t had a chance to sit down with Valgrind yet and run the Wand unit tests
through it to make sure that I got <em>all</em> of the leaks. I&rsquo;ll have to do that
before I do any sort of public release of my software;
I don&rsquo;t want to rely on a leaky library.</p>

<p>Beyond the leaks, I ran into another memory issue which proved problematic:
resizing photographs can use a great deal of memory, which is extremely limited
on a reasonably-priced <acronym title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</acronym>.
I have limited knowledge about image processing in general and ImageMagick in
particular, but I&rsquo;m not aware of any resizing algorithms which can operate
directly on compressed image data, and if any such algorithms exist, ImageMagick
doesn&rsquo;t use them. That being the case, to resize an image, the entire image has
to be loaded into memory decompressed. For an 8 megapixel photograph at 24 bits
per pixel, that means allocating approximately 183MB of memory.</p>

<p>On a 512MB VPS, this means that trying to resize three images
concurrently&mdash;or even sequentially in some cases, since Python isn&rsquo;t
guaranteed to immediately relinquish allocated memory to the operating system
when objects resident in that memory are &ldquo;deleted&rdquo;&mdash;practically guarantees
that the process will be killed by the
<acronym title="Out Of Memory">OOM</acronym> killer.</p>

<p>This goes hand in hand with another complication, which is that resizing images
is too slow to be done in the same server thread that&rsquo;s handling requests and
generating responses. For each image that&rsquo;s uploaded, I save several different
sizes for different purposes, and due to the aforementioned memory constraints I
can&rsquo;t even resize them concurrently. Resizing each image several times in the
responding thread drastically reduces throughput for the client
since it incurs a significant wait time for the server to process each image
after it&rsquo;s uploaded.</p>

<h2>Enter Subprocess</h2>

<p>So here&rsquo;s the solution I&rsquo;ve come up with for the time being, and I&rsquo;m very unsure
whether or not it&rsquo;s actually a good solution, so please do let me know in the
comments if there&rsquo;s a better way to do this.  When a new image is uploaded, the
responding thread saves the image in the appropriate directory and adds it to
the database, but does not resize it.  For each of the sizes that the image
needs to be resized to, it adds a task to a
<a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/queue.html">synchronous queue</a>. The queue is
consumed by a different thread which runs throughout the lifetime of the
application. That thread maintains a (thread-local) queue of
<a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html">subprocesses</a> with a
configurable maximum length. When a new resizing task is consumed, if there is
room in the subprocess queue, a new subprocess is spawned to resize the image.
Otherwise, the thread joins the subprocess at the front of the queue so as to
block until there&rsquo;s room to spawn a new subprocess. The exit code of completed
processes is checked to ensure that the resize was successful; in case of
failure, the task is re-added to the back of the task queue.</p>

<p>This guarantees that the application server itself will never be killed by the
OOM killer since it uses minimal memory. It never has to load images into
memory; all of that is done in the resizing subprocesses.  By configuring the
maximum number of concurrent subprocesses, one can scale this solution according
to available resources: if you have plenty of RAM, you can resize many images
concurrently and get through the queue faster, or if you have very little, you
can limit the queue to one or two processes to minimize the chance that anything
will be OOM killed.</p>

<p>The subprocess spawning notwithstanding, this is a pretty standard task queue
model, so you might be wondering why I didn&rsquo;t use something like
<a href="http://celeryproject.org/">Celery</a> in conjunction with a real message queue.
It comes down to minimizing the number of external dependencies and maximizing
ease of use. My project already depends on a number of libraries which will have
to be installed by users. To the greatest extent that I can do so without
compromising on features, I want to avoid complicating the installation further
by adding more dependencies. Celery is particularly difficult to install as it
requires installing and configuring a broker and managing processes for both the
broker and Celery itself. Were I writing a large-scale service and maintaining a
single backend for hundreds of users, it would probably be the right choice, but
as I am writing software for users to install on their own servers, it is
probably not.</p>

<p>This method works fairly well and it&rsquo;s the best I&rsquo;ve come up with so far, but
something about it makes it feel more like a hack than a well thought out and
robust solution. I also wonder if it defeats the purpose of using Wand in the
first place; I use it for very little other than resizing, and since I&rsquo;m going
to the trouble of spawning subprocesses to do that, perhaps it would actually be
better to just directly invoke the ImageMagick binaries. As mentioned above, I
have concerns about what impact that would have in different environments, but I
haven&rsquo;t really validated those concerns; they&rsquo;re just hunches.</p>

<h2>The Road Ahead</h2>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve got a workable, if not perfect, solution to one of the biggest problems
I encountered&hellip; but as I mentioned previously, there&rsquo;s still much work to be
done. Here are a few (but not all) of the things I&rsquo;d like to do before I release
anything publicly:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lots of UI work.</strong> Right now the app works very poorly on phones and iPads.
I also need to figure out how to make certain features more discoverable, and
although I&rsquo;m happy with how albums look right now, there are still some extra
touches that I want to add which I haven&rsquo;t yet been able to (because CSS and
HTML suck.)</li>
<li><strong>Better administrative tools.</strong> Uploading works great, but I have very
barebones interfaces for editing albums right now. There is currently no means
of rotating a photo from the editing interface (although doing so should
almost never be necessary since the app automatically rotates images which
have EXIF orientation data.)</li>
<li><strong>Mirroring and proxying to cloud storage services</strong> such as Azure and S3. VPS
resources are very expensive; extra disk space on some popular hosts runs
around a dollar per gigabyte per month. That&rsquo;s ten times the cost of disk
space on the cloud storage services I&rsquo;ve looked at. Cloud-hosted images might
also improve load speeds for visitors.</li>
<li><strong>Comments.</strong> This one is pretty big, obviously, but I haven&rsquo;t added it yet
because I can&rsquo;t decide on how best to handle it. I&rsquo;d like to avoid writing my
own comment system and requiring potential commenters to sign up for yet
another account. (I&rsquo;d use Persona for commenter identification and
authentication just as I do for the admin login, but very few people currently
have Persona accounts or even know what it is.) I like Disqus, but I&rsquo;m not
sure it would integrate well with the minimalist interface I&rsquo;ve designed.</li>
<li><strong>Geotagging and maps.</strong> I&rsquo;m already reading GPS data from EXIF tags where
available, but now I need to do something with it. I&rsquo;d like to add the ability
to manually add locations to photos and albums, and to have a map that shows
where photos were taken.</li>
</ul>


<p>Those five items represent maybe a quarter to a third of the work I still have
planned, so to repeat myself again, there&rsquo;s a lot of work to do. But I&rsquo;m very
happy with the progress I&rsquo;ve made so far, and I feel confident that I can get
this finished. It&rsquo;s just a matter of when.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>David Somers presents an
<a href="http://labs.newsint.co.uk/blog/2012/10/why-mozilla-persona-is-the-right-answer-to-the-question-of-identity/">excellent rundown</a>
of what
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/">Mozilla Persona</a> is and why it&rsquo;s
currently the best option for identity and authentication for web services. I&rsquo;ve
implemented authentication using Persona in the
<a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2012/09/14/social-networks-and-content-ownership/">photo album app</a>
I&rsquo;m working on, and I found it remarkably easy to integrate with my app. And, as
David explains, Persona is also much easier for users to understand than
competing platforms like OpenID. If you&rsquo;re a web developer, you really need to
add Persona support to your application as soon as
possible. It can be done in literally a matter of minutes, and if Persona takes
off the benefit to identity management on the Internet could be huge.</p>

<p>Perhaps my favourite thing about Persona is that it gives me the opportunity to
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Persona/Implementing_a_Persona_IdP">implement my own identity provider</a>,
which means I can have <em>complete</em> control over how I authenticate to any
Persona-consuming service. I could have <em>n</em>-factor authentication, with no limit
on the complexity or specificity of the factors besides my own imagination. For
example, I could generate SSL client certificates for each of my machines and
hardcode their thumbprints into my identity provider to ensure that it wouldn&rsquo;t
even service requests from machines I haven&rsquo;t explicitly added.  Or if I wanted
to get creative, I could have my identity provider generate a random temporary
key which I would have to retrieve via SSH (but this is less convenient and
probably also less secure than doing SSL client authentication.) The
possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>Perhaps an end is finally in sight to the frustration of having dozens upon
dozens of different accounts and passwords for various services,
<a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2011/12/04/fuck-passwords/">each with its own uniquely nonsensical password composition policy</a>.  Everyone needs to implement Persona&mdash;preferably yesterday.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2012/09/23/switching-to-octopress/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-23T23:22:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2012/09/23/switching-to-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Wordpress on various sites that I&rsquo;ve maintained for probably the
better part of a decade now. By most metrics, it&rsquo;s still very good blogging
software; I&rsquo;m not aware of any self-hostable alternative that can match
Wordpress in terms of the union of ease of use, feature set and flexibility that
it provides. That said, lately I&rsquo;ve been feeling that perhaps Wordpress is no
longer the right choice for my specific needs. These are my problems with it:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not very good for sharing source code. There are a multitude of plugins
available for syntax highlighting; the best of them seems to be
<a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">Alex Gorbatchev&rsquo;s Syntax Highlighter</a>,
which is used by
<a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> and is also what I was using on my blog.
But I&rsquo;ve had problems with the Wordpress converting some of the characters in
my code to HTML entities (e.g. <code>&amp;amp;</code> for &amp; ) which are then printed
literally by the plugin.</li>
<li>I find that more often than not Wordpress&#8217; visual editor is
insufficient for the formatting I want in my posts. That forces me to use
the raw HTML editor. That would be fine, except that Wordpress has a strange
sort of off-spec way of storing post HTML. Paragraph and line break tags are
omitted in the editor and the database, and are added when the page is
actually rendered to the client. This is okay, I guess, and I <em>think</em>
Wordpress is smart enough to not insert extra paragraph tags if you do wrap
your own paragraphs with them. Still, it leads to some unpredictability with
regard to how a post with hand-written HTML will actually be rendered.</li>
<li>A similar but worse problem occurs when you try to insert extra line breaks.
Even if you&rsquo;re using the raw HTML editor to insert <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> tags, Wordpress
will just get rid of them unless you insert additional non-breaking spaces
(<code>&amp;nbsp;</code>) so that it thinks the lines are non-empty. But! If you switch back
to the visual editor for any reason, even your <code>&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;</code> lines will be
wiped out. Even for &ldquo;average&rdquo; users I can&rsquo;t think of any situation in which
this &ldquo;feature&rdquo; would be desirable. If I put a bunch of extra newlines into
something I&rsquo;m writing, it is because <em>I want exactly that many newlines.</em> I
tend to not have much patience for software that thinks it&rsquo;s smarter than
I am; that is why I still write most of my code in <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>
and use hand-written makefiles in an age of
<acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym>s.</li>
<li>Never-ending updates. It seems like every time I log in there&rsquo;s a new update
to download. Wordpress has updates down to a one-click install process, so
this wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a problem except for the fact that
every time I have to update Wordpress warns me that I should back up my
database first. Why? Is there a significant possibility that the update might
break everything? It&rsquo;s probably just a
<acronym title="Cover Our Asses">COA</acronym>, and I back up my database
daily anyway, but this whole aspect of Wordpress makes me uneasy and I don&rsquo;t
want to have to deal with it any more. Even though I&rsquo;m covered for backups,
recovering from a botched update would undoubtedly be a nightmare.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress#Vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities.</a> One
of the big reasons that Wordpress is updated so frequently is that it has a
long history of security vulnerabilities, and more are still being discovered
and patched. This also means that if I don&rsquo;t log in frequently enough to
download new security patches, I&rsquo;m at risk of having my site compromised,
loaded up with malware and blacklisted by Google.</li>
<li><p>It&rsquo;s written in PHP. <a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">PHP sucks.</a>
(I can&rsquo;t link to that enough.) I don&rsquo;t want to be dogmatic about technology
choices; good software is good software regardless of what language it&rsquo;s
written in, and my primary desire is always to use whatever is best for the
task at hand. But lately I&rsquo;ve been pretty vocal, both here and in person with
friends and colleagues, about how bad PHP is. Continuing to rely on it
undermines my credibility on the issue and makes me a bit of a hypocrite.</p>

<p>And while this might seem trivial or pedantic, it&rsquo;s
actually one of the root causes of almost all of the issues above; the weird
HTML handling, inappropriate entity conversion, and security issues are all
due, at least in part, to bad design patterns popularized and perpetuated by
PHP. Wordpress still uses raw non-parameterized SQL queries; blogging software
built on a modern web framework with a proper
<acronym title="Object-Relational Mapping">ORM</acronym>
would not be plagued by SQL
injection exploits as Wordpress has been historically and probably continues
to be.</p></li>
<li>Wordpress supports themes so that you can customize the apperance of your
site, but editing them kind of sucks, because they&rsquo;re all written in PHP
instead of a proper templating language. Years ago I actually wrote a lot of
PHP, but I still find Wordpress templates pretty ugly and difficult to
understand; they seem more verbose than should really be necessary for what
they accomplish, and have, on average, more <code>&lt;?php ?&gt;</code> sections than a
keyboard has keys. (That analogy sucked. Sorry, it&rsquo;s late. What I&rsquo;m trying to
say is that there are a lot of them.)</li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->


<p>So recently I got it into my head to switch over to
<a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress.</a> Octopress bills itself as &ldquo;a blogging
framework for hackers,&rdquo; which is an attractive description given my
<a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/categories/coding">predilections.</a> It uses
<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> to generate static pages from a set
of templates and content written in
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown.</a><sup>1</sup> It is,
without a doubt, harder to use than to Wordpress, but it has the following
advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rendering static pages once and serving dynamic content via AJAX is much more
efficient than rendering entire pages dynamically for each visitor. This isn&rsquo;t
really a concern for me because this is a very low-traffic site, and I have an
entire quad-core <acronym title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</acronym>
doing basically nothing besides serving this site. That said, it&rsquo;s nice to
know that when I start doing other stuff on my VPS, I won&rsquo;t be contending for
cycles with PHP and MySQL, so the site will always be very responsive. Plus,
wow does the site load fast now (once you have that huge header image cached,
anyway. I&rsquo;ll fix that soon.) Also not a huge concern for a blog, but I
didn&rsquo;t expect the difference to even be noticeable, and it definitely is.</li>
<li>Static pages significantly decrease the attack surface of the site; there is
no database, so no SQL injection to worry about, and no scripts are being
executed, so <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/520827">PHP vulnerabilities</a>
aren&rsquo;t a concern.</li>
<li>Static pages means I get a nicely organized, easily navigable directory
structure instead of God-awful rewrite rules.</li>
<li>The default Octopress theme is very well designed and well-suited to
customization.  I was able to modify it to make it look almost exactly like my
old custom Wordpress theme did, while retaining the fully fluid layout of the
Octopress theme&mdash;meaning that the layout will resize to look beautiful at
any screen resolution, including on mobile devices.</li>
<li>Octopress has pretty nice built in Github and Twitter widgets.</li>
<li>Comments are handled by <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>, which provides a nicer
comment system than Wordpress&#8217; built in comments.  I was using Disqus anyway
via a plugin, but now I don&rsquo;t have to worry about keeping the Disqus comments
synced with the Wordpress database. Incidentally, Disqus provides a very nice
system to migrate comments to new URLs by uploading a
<acronym title="Comma Separate Value">CSV</acronym> file mapping old URLs to
new URLs. They&rsquo;ve really thought of everything, so props to them for providing
a great service.</li>
<li>All of the blog content is stored on my local machine, which means I can write
posts in a disconnected environment using Vim, version control them with Git,
and then push them to my server when they&rsquo;re finished. I have a nice
deployment setup where everything is stored in a Git repository on the server
and a post-commit hook copies the updated content to the web root for the blog
subdomain. All I have to do is <code>git push</code> and the blog is instantly updated.</li>
<li>Since Wordpress uses hand-written SQL queries, it is tightly coupled with
MySQL and doesn&rsquo;t support any other database. PHP is similarly tied to Apache;
while it&rsquo;s possible to run it with other servers, it&rsquo;s not particularly easy.
By ditching Wordpress, I can also get rid of Apache, PHP and MySQL. This is
nice since I was planning to use nginx and Postgres for my
<a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2012/09/14/social-networks-and-content-ownership/">photo album project</a>
anyway.</li>
</ul>


<p>Those are, give or take a few minor considerations, my reasons for switching
blogging platforms. I&rsquo;d be remiss to not mention that Octopress does have some
noteworthy disadvantages even for &ldquo;power users&rdquo; to whom the above advantages
might sound attractive.
<a href="http://alblue.bandlem.com/2012/02/disadvantages-of-octopress.html" title="Disadvantages of Octopress - AlBlue's Blog">This post</a>
does a good job cataloguing a few of them. On the balance, though, I feel like
it&rsquo;s a good choice for me, and although the switch took me considerably longer
than I expected (the better part of an weekend where I&rsquo;d expected an evening or
so of work), I&rsquo;m pretty happy that I did it.</p>

<p>In an upcoming post, I&rsquo;ll discuss the actual process of reconfiguring my server
and importing all of my content (which is what I had planned to do before this
turned into a 1,600 word diatribe against Wordpress.) For now, if I&rsquo;ve inspired
you and you&rsquo;re thinking about switching your own Wordpress site to Octopress,
you can take a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/mlindgren/wp2octopress"><acronym title="Extract, Transform, Load">ETL</acronym> I wrote</a>
to ease the import process.</p>

recently, I didn&rsquo;t. And here I thought all he did was play apologist for
Apple.</small></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m not usually much enamoured with interview-style programming puzzles because I find that a lot of them are actually more akin to math problems, trivial to implement once you figure out the salient mathematical property.  I think I have a decent intuition for math, and I certainly took enough math courses in high school and college to give me a solid foundation in the fundamentals of algebra, geometry, statistics, calculus, etc., but I&rsquo;m not confident enough in my math skills to be entirely comfortable being judged by my ability to exercise them.</p>

<p>There are some programming puzzles I really enjoy, though.  This evening I happened across one such puzzle, via <a title="@eevee on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/eevee" target="_blank">Eevee&rsquo;s Twitter</a>: &#8221;<a title="Reversing the Interview Process - Exodus Intelligence" href="http://blog.exodusintel.com/2012/09/18/reversing-the-interview-process/" target="_blank">implement a strlen() function in C that, when compiled, would not contain any conditional branches</a>.&ldquo;  (The page contains solutions, so don&rsquo;t read the orange text if you want to try this yourself.)  This is exactly the kind of puzzle I like; it&rsquo;s fun to think about, reasonably challenging, and requires knowledge of language features combined with creative thinking.</p>

<p>My solution is below, but I&rsquo;d recommend that you go give this a try yourself before you read on.</p>

<p>As you can see, the solution is actually very simple, but there are a couple of tricks necessary to make it work.  First of all, you obviously can&rsquo;t use a loop to count the characters because a loop requires a conditional jump to either terminate or continue.  You could still use a loop-like construct such as <code>goto</code>, but that only reframes the problem; you still need to make a decision about when to jump out.</p>

<p>So, the problem can basically be reduced to this: how can you make a decision without using a conditional?  Well, you can index into an array of possibilities using some property that you can derive from your input.  In this case, the most important property is that the characters can be grouped into two sets: terminating characters (i.e. <code>&lsquo;\0&rsquo;</code>) and non-terminating characters (all others).  On that basis, our array of possibilites can consist of two function pointers, one which continues recursively and the other which terminates.</p>

<p>The only problem remaining is how to group the characters, again without using conditionals.  My first thought here was actually to divide the character by itself, in which case all non-terminating characters would be 1, and the null terminator would be&hellip; oh, a divide-by-zero error. I quickly dismissed that thought and realized that binary not is a simpler way to map the characters.  However, Eevee came up with what I think is <a href="https://gist.github.com/3746130" title="Eevee's solution on Github" target="_blank">a very clever and quite unorthodox solution</a> involving division by handling the <code>SIGFPE</code> generated by the division by zero and using the handler to change an unconditional jump address.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d recommend also checking out the solutions provided in the <a title="Reversing the Interview Process - Exodus Intelligence" href="http://blog.exodusintel.com/2012/09/18/reversing-the-interview-process/" target="_blank">original post</a>; all three of them are a bit more elegant than mine, if perhaps a bit more difficult to understand.  (In particular, the count parameter that I use is superfluous, although I don&rsquo;t consider the difference particularly important since it can easily be hidden in my solution using a macro or helper function.)</p>

<p>Since my solution isn&rsquo;t significantly different from those presented in the original post, I wanted to go a bit further and take a look at the performance implications of not using conditionals.  Yeah, yeah, premature optimization is the root of all evil and all that&mdash;I&rsquo;m just doing this out of curiosity; regardless of the results, I would never go this far out of my way to avoid a conditional jump in a real program, nor would I recommend doing so to anyone else.    I decided to compare my solution above against a naïve implementation with a while loop; comparing it against <code>strlen()</code> from <code>string.h</code> would be pretty meaningless because it would be linked against a precompiled library which, for all I know, could be hand-optimized.  So here&rsquo;s the code I&rsquo;m using instead:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>I&rsquo;m assigning the result to a volatile int to ensure that even when the code is optimized, the compiler won&rsquo;t completely optimize out the function call.  So, first, predictions: anyone who has taken a computer architecture course will tell you that conditional jumps can be very expensive because of the recovery the CPU has to do if the branch is mispredicted.  However, branch predictors typically have very high accuracy, and there&rsquo;s also a significant overhead involved in putting the parameters and return address on the stack when a function is called.  Therefore, I predict that in that with no compiler optimization, the while loop will be faster.</p>

<p>&hellip;And, it is.  Running each function in a loop 100,000 times on a 23-character string, the average over five trials was 28,699 µsec for the non-conditional version and 9,012 µsec for the while loop.  Using a fixed string will cause the branch predictor to have near-perfect accuracy in the while loop version, so there might be a slight difference if I used a large array of strings of randomized lengths, but I doubt it would be significant.</p>

<p>But what if we let the compiler (llvm-gcc in this case) optimize it?  I don&rsquo;t know enough about compiler optimization in general or llvm-gcc in particular to predict what will happen here.  The non-conditional <code>strlen()</code> is tail recursive so the compiler will optimize out the extra function calls at <code>-O2</code> and above, but what will be optimized beyond that I really don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>As it turns out, compiling at <code>-O3</code> and running 100,000 times on the same 23-character string, the non-conditional function took an average of 11,182 µsec over five trials.  That&rsquo;s a significant improvement, but it&rsquo;s still slower than the unoptimized while loop, so it obviously won&rsquo;t beat that.  And indeed, the optimized while loop takes only 3,072 µsec.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(<a title="The state of Python imaging - Eevee's Livejournal" href="http://eevee.livejournal.com/307299.html" target="_blank">With apologies to Eevee</a>, of whom I am a great fan.)</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;m <a title="Social networks and content ownership - mlindgren.ca" href="http://mlindgren.ca/blog/archives/597" target="_blank">working on a photo album app written in Python.</a>  I&rsquo;m using Python because, well, I love it.  I think it&rsquo;s the perfect language for web development; it&rsquo;s simple and very readable, and ample syntactic sugar and just the right mix of procedural and functional features almost completely eliminate tedious boilerplate.  As a trivial example for those who have never used Python, consider:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">db_tags</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">dict</span><span class="p">([(</span><span class="n">tag</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">tag</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">tag</span> <span class="ow">in</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What I&rsquo;m doing here is grabbing all of the EXIF tags I know about out of my database with <a title="SQLAlchemy" href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/" target="_blank">SQLAlchemy</a> (also awesome, by the way), and creating a dictionary which maps each tag&rsquo;s name to the corresponding <acronym title="Object-Relational Mapper">ORM</acronym> object; I can find the ORM object simply with <code>db_tags[tag_name]</code>, which lets me easily and efficiently insert new tag values as I read <acronym title="Exchangeable Image File Format">EXIF</acronym> data from a photo.  This isn&rsquo;t particularly <em>difficult</em> to do in any other language; as I said, it&rsquo;s a trivial example.  But consider how much more verbose the code would be: PHP, which is still the most popular language for web applications despite being an <a title="PHP: A Fractal of Bad Design - Fuzzy Notepad" href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/" target="_blank">incorrigible pile of garbage</a>, doesn&rsquo;t have list comprehensions.  I don&rsquo;t even want to think about how many lines of code this would take in Java; additionally, while I&rsquo;m unfamiliar with them in general, I suspect Java ORMs require the use of generics to a painful extent (i.e. more than not at all).  In Python it only takes one <acronym title="Source Line Of Code">SLOC</acronym>, without sacrificing any readability.<sup>1, 2</sup></p>

<p>So, Python&rsquo;s pretty great. But like all languages, it does have a few problems. The one I have had the most difficulty with in my current project is that third party library support is somewhat lacking in some important areas; specifically, there aren&rsquo;t many good options for reading and manipulating images. The most popular library seems to be the <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">Python Imaging Library</a>, PIL. It&rsquo;s easy enough to install and provides a <em>passable</em> set of core features, but doesn&rsquo;t go much beyond that.  For instance, none of the various camera raw formats seem to be supported, which I consider a fairly important feature for my photo album; I&rsquo;d very much like be able to upload original raws and have the application automatically convert them to JPEGs for me.  Additionally, it doesn&rsquo;t provide much in the way of convenience methods for cropping and resizing images.  <a title="ImageMagick" href="http://www.imagemagick.org/" target="_blank">ImageMagick</a> has <a title="ImageMagick geometry" href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php#geometry" target="_blank">a very nice means of specifying cropping and resizing geometry</a> with various aspect ratio-preserving (or not) behaviour, and I wanted to be able to leverage something similar for my app so that I could quickly prototype with various size options.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Given that ImageMagick provides most of the functionality I want that PIL lacks, it seemed like a good option, but it&rsquo;s a C library and Python doesn&rsquo;t yet have mature bindings for it.  It&rsquo;s getting there, though!  I decided to go with <a title="Python Wand library" href="http://dahlia.kr/wand/index.html" target="_blank">Wand</a>, which is a fork of python-magickwand.  It has a nice high-level API, but also provides direct access to most of the low-level MagickWand APIs, making it fairly flexible.  When I first found it, it did not have support for the nice geometry specifications I wanted to use, but being an open source project I was able to patch that in.  <a title="Wand version 0.2.2" href="http://dahlia.kr/wand/changes.html#version-0-2-2" target="_blank">Version 0.2.2</a> will include my patch, which provides the <code>Image.transform</code> method for easy cropping and resizing.  Eevee is also <a title="Sanpera - Eevee's Github" href="https://github.com/eevee/sanpera" target="_blank">working on a Python imaging library</a>, which is promising, but it&rsquo;s still a work in progress.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Wand doesn&rsquo;t yet support retrieving EXIF, <acronym title="International Press Telecommunications Council">IPTC</acronym> or <acronym title="Extensible Metadata Platform">XMP</acronym> metadata from images, which is another requirement for me.  ImageMagick does support EXIF at least, and that&rsquo;s on the roadmap for Wand, but implementing a high-level interface for EXIF tags is a bigger task than I have time for at the moment.  That meant that I had to turn to another library to retrieve metadata.  <a title="pyexiv2 library" href="http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/" target="_blank">pyexiv2</a>, a Python binding for the exiv2 C++ library, initially looked promising.  Unfortunately I discovered that it&rsquo;s not installable via any Python package manager; it must be built from source (via a build system I&rsquo;ve never even heard of, and I&rsquo;m familiar with more than a few build systems), unless a binary is provided for your platform by the project maintainers (i.e. you are on Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora or Windows).</p>

<p>My project already has more dependencies than I&rsquo;m entirely comfortable with; one of the reasons that Python only has modest adoption as a web application platform despite being a great language for the task is that it doesn&rsquo;t have a kitchen sink-style standard library, and third-party libraries require separate installation.  In general I consider that a good thing; I&rsquo;d rather have a well-designed standard library than a <a title="PHP: A Fractal of Bad Design - Fuzzy Notepad" href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/#general" target="_blank">gigantic mishmash of inconsistently named global functions.</a>  However, it does make deployment a little more complex.  So far I&rsquo;ve managed to stick to libraries which can be installed in one step using well-known package managers, so the setup procedure for my app should not be too arduous.  Adding pyexiv2 as a dependency and thereby including an entirely different build system in the process would likely have complicated the installation procedure to the point that no actual ordinary humans would ever use my application.  That&rsquo;s something I want to avoid, if possible.</p>

<p><del>For now I have settled for exif-py.</del>  It only handles EXIF tags, not IPTC or XMP, which is disappointing because I really wanted to support multiple metadata formats.  It&rsquo;s a pure Python library in a single file, though, so I can just include with my distribution.  It&rsquo;s easy to use and gets the job done, so it will have to do for now.  I&rsquo;m hoping that pyexiv2 will show up in pip (a Python package manager) at some point, though.  [<strong>Updated September 16, 2012: </strong>I&rsquo;ve discovered that exif-py is broken in at least a couple significant ways, so I&rsquo;m kind of back at square one for handling metadata.  exif-py seems to be unable to detect EXIF data in some files that have it.  Additionally, the strings that it translates orientation codes to are not consistent with each other, so they&rsquo;re basically wrong.  I&rsquo;ve informed the maintainers of these issues, but I don&rsquo;t have time to fix them myself.]</p>

<p>The process of trying to find a good imaging package for Python and ultimately settling for two separate libraries which still don&rsquo;t quite do everything I want has made it clear to me that third party library support for Python still has a way to go.  Hopefully the situation will improve as adoption of the language increases.  I&rsquo;m happy to do my part, both through contributions to open source libraries such as Wand, and by building apps using Python to bolster the ecosystem.  I hope that by demonstrating what&rsquo;s possible with Python as a web application platform, I can help convince new web developers to build their applications using Python as well&hellip; which provides yet more reason for me to be diligent about finishing my photo album app!</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <small>Okay, the <code>dict</code> function is perhaps not the most explicit. Check the docs once, though, and it&rsquo;s very easy to understand.</small><br/>
<sup>2</sup> <small>Ruby would doubtless be similarly concise, and it seems like a nice language in my limited experience, but I find its syntax and distinction between &ldquo;symbols&rdquo; and strings to not be to my taste.</small></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m always wary about pre-announcing things I&rsquo;m working on; I have more ambition than spare time, which leads to a tendency to start projects and not finish them.  But if there&rsquo;s to be a point in maintaining this website, I need to actually <em>write things</em> once in a while, so I may as well write about what I&rsquo;ve been hacking on lately.  At the moment, I&rsquo;m building a web-based photo album in Python.  My primary reason for doing this is that I&rsquo;d like to own more of my information.  Apps and social networks have some significant advantages, particularly for the less technologically inclined, but I&rsquo;m ambivalent about the trend away from an open Internet and towards a set of non-interoperable, monolithic walled-garden services.<!-- more --></p>

<p>When Google+ debuted, my enthusiasm for the service followed a sort of bell curve.  I was already using Twitter and Facebook, and I didn&rsquo;t want to have to post everything to yet another service.  At the urging of friends, I joined anyway, and warmed to it considerably.  It was simply better software than Facebook; the interface was cleaner, the privacy controls more usable, the communication options more diverse, the means of sharing and interacting with media more engaging and deeply integrated.  Best of all, there wasn&rsquo;t nearly as much app spam.  Much of this is probably still true, although the impression I get from Google+ pages I&rsquo;ve stumbled across recently is that they&rsquo;ve been trying to make it look more like Facebook, to its detriment.</p>

<p>Realizing that it was a better product in almost every regard, I started using Google+ almost exclusively and tried to recruit additional friends away from Facebook.  I stopped uploading new photos to Facebook and even purchased additional storage capacity on Google+ so I could upload all of my photos there at the original quality.  Problems quickly became apparent, though.  Despite my best efforts, nobody was using the service; even among those of my friends who were enthusiastic early adopters, actual <em>social</em> activity among my circles dropped off quickly, and I soon found myself wondering why I even bothered to check for updates.  I finally deleted my account when I logged in one day and realized that the newest post in my news feed was from several months prior.</p>

<p>And with my Google+ account, there went all of the photos and other content I had uploaded.  I still have the files, of course, but the effort I expended in selecting a handful of good photos to upload to each gallery from the hundreds of shots I take on most outings, not to mention the comments, captions, and other metadata I had curated, vanished into the ether with not a trace left behind.  The moral of the story is that private social networks are impermanent, and thus anything uploaded to them necessarily has an unknown but very much finite period of accessibility and relevance.  Whether or not Google ever admits it, Google+ never quite took off, but it could have supplanted Facebook just as Facebook did MySpace.  If and when some other service comes along and succeeds where Google+ failed, every user on Facebook will be forced to start over from scratch on whatever&rsquo;s in vogue next.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m tired of playing that game. I want to keep control over the content I create so that I can truly decide how it&rsquo;s shared and with whom, and so that if I need to migrate my data to a new system, I have the means to do so.<sup>1</sup> The ultimate realization of this ideal is in decentralized services based on open protocols, such as <a title="Tent" href="http://tent.io/">Tent</a>. I&rsquo;m very enthusiastic about such attempts, but realistically, I&rsquo;m skeptical that any of them will ever gain the necessary traction to make a real difference. Even if Tent or some analogue gains millions of users, it will be a drop in the bucket compared to Facebook, and entrenched players such as Facebook will have no incentive to interoperate because decentralized services do nothing but threaten their business model.</p>

<p>I will do as much as is in my power to help services like Tent succeed, but for the time being, that is not much.  That kind of leaves me without a good means of pushing my content to the people who care about it.  Nevertheless, I can still take ownership of it by hosting it on my own server using my own tools.  That is the purpose of developing my own photo album software.  I&rsquo;m making good progress so far, and hopefully soon I&rsquo;ll have more to share; once the code is in a reasonably complete state with most of the major features I want for my own purposes, I intend to make the app open source and share the code on my <a title="mlindgren on Github" href="https://github.com/mlindgren" target="_blank">Github account.</a>  And now that I&rsquo;ve announced my intent publicly, I expect anyone who reads this to hold me to my plan to ensure that I get it finished!</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <small>Both Facebook and Google+ provide a means of exporting the data you&rsquo;ve shared. I believe both will export everything belonging to you personally, but I don&rsquo;t think you necessarily get to keep all of the social data associated with your content, e.g. comments, nor the relationships between different pieces of content. Last I checked, the data was merely dumped into a bunch of flat files; nothing is kept in a structured format that makes it easy to work with, and even if it were, other privates services don&rsquo;t usually offer the option to import your data. While it may still not be easy, if you own your own data and manage it using open source tools, it&rsquo;s at least <em>possible</em> to migrate everything to another system with the greatest fidelity supported by that system.</small></p>

    <id>http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2012/02/03/some-thoughts-on-used-games-and-online-passes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Online passes are becoming more and more ubiquitous in the games industry.  For those who aren&rsquo;t familiar with the terminology, an online pass is essentially a form of digital rights management designed to discourage and devalue used game sales by tying some game content to unique, one-use codes packaged with new copies of games.  Online passes are a contentious issue.  Some feel that they&rsquo;re a perfectly legitimate way for developers and publishers to ensure that they get their cut of each sale, and to reward those who purchase games new.  Others see them as a violation of consumer rights or contend that they inconvenience customers who <em>do</em> buy new (by requiring them to type in long access codes on game controllers) while being of only dubious value to publishers and developers.</p>

<p>Most recently, there&rsquo;s been a bit of an uproar over the inclusion of an online pass in <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdoms_of_Amalur:_Reckoning">Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning</a></em>, a single-player RPG with no online component.  The pass confers seven extra quests on those who purchase the game new, or deprives those who purchased used of them, depending on your perspective.<!-- more -->  Before I lay my cards on the table, I&rsquo;ll let Curt Schilling, the founder of the studio behind the game, explain what he sees the purpose of the online pass as:</p>

<blockquote>That being said, this next part is likely to piss people off, but it&#8217;s a truth and it&#8217;s how I feel. You can argue the merits and effectiveness of it, but right now it&#8217;s how it&#8217;s done and as someone that&#8217;s as invested as I am in this company, I stand by what has happened.

DAY 1 DLC, to be extremely and VIVIDLY clear, is FREE, 100% totally FREE, to anyone that buys a new copy of Reckoning, ANYONE. 

If you don&#8217;t buy new games you buy them used, and in that case you will have to pay for the Day 1 free DLC content the new copy buyers got for free.

It&#8217;s clear the intent right? To promote early adopters and MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO ME, REWARD fans and gamers who commit to us with their time and money when it benefits the company.</blockquote>


<p>You can read the rest of his post <a href="http://forums.reckoning.amalur.com/showthread.php?3063-Did-you-push-back-at-EA-at-all-over-this-Quest-content-gated-by-online-pass.&s=2ba8c3194088140ce6161b0c374691f5&p=52812&viewfull=1#post52812" title="Curt Schilling's post on the Kingdoms of Amalur online pass.">on the Kingdoms of Amalur forum.</a>  I think Curt&rsquo;s position is reasonable and I am sympathetic to the frustration he&rsquo;s clearly feeling; he believes that he&rsquo;s trying to protect his business interests and in the process rewarding loyal fans with free bonus content, and receiving nothing but scorn in return.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think <em>Kingdoms of Amalur</em>&rsquo;s online pass is an egregious abuse by any means, but in general,  I do count myself among those who see online passes as an unsettling trend.  I think consumers have good reason to be suspicious of companies that choose to use online passes.  There are good arguments for and against online passes, but the most popular arguments in favor of online passes often seem to rely on strawmen and dubious assumptions with no supporting data.  Jerry Holkins (Tycho) of Penny Arcade <a href="http://penny-arcade.com/2012/01/30/plurality" title="Plurality - Penny Arcade">writes:</a></p>

<blockquote>I&#8217;ve been reading a lot his weekend about Fat Cats and how fat they are and how they want your money, but the only choice you get in this matter (aside from the wholly valid &#8220;not buying it&#8221; choice, of course) is which supposed Fat Cat to enrich.  You can enrich the people who made the game you are enjoying, or you can enrich people who had nothing to do with the game.  Policies like this are designed to incentivize new purchases: that is to say, sales.  We call those sales.</blockquote>


<p>In other words, you&rsquo;re either supporting the developers who produce the games you love, or you&rsquo;re supporting retailers like Gamestop.  Naturally most consumers would prefer the former, all else being equal; developers are creative entities, focused&mdash;or so we can hope&mdash;on artistic expression before profit.  Retailers, by contrast, are often viewed as greedy and incidental vestiges of the rapidly dying era of physical media.  Their services are at best unnecessary, and at worst <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2011/08/24/gamestop-intentionally-removing-deus-ex-onlive-coupons-from-reta/" title="Gamestop intentionally removing Deus Ex OnLive coupons from retail PC copies - Joystiq">abusive of their customers to an extent that would make an ardent objectivist blush.</a></p>

<p>This is a false dichotomy for two reasons.  First, traditional retailers are not the only avenues for the trading and selling of used games.  One could trade games directly with friends or colleagues, or buy and sell them at garage sales and flea markets.  There are even a number of online services that have been created for the explicit purpose of allowing consumers to trade and sell used games at reasonable prices.  (Of course, those services take a cut too, but I think it&rsquo;s safe to assume that their margins are nothing like Gamestop&rsquo;s, and they are much more consumer-centric in general.)</p>

<p>More importantly, there is an implicit assumption in Holkins&#8217; argument that each used sale deprives the publisher of a new sale.  This is the same false equivalency that the <acronym title="Motion Picture Association of America">MPAA</acronym> and <acronym title="Recording Industry Association of America">RIAA</acronym> have been using for years to <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/223431/riaa_thinks_limewire_owes_75_trillion_in_damages.html" title="RIAA thinks Limewire owes $75 trillion in damages" target="_blank">overstate the negative effects of piracy</a>, and it is no less pernicious when applied to secondhand markets.  To the best of my knowledge there is absolutely no data to support this assertion, and it doesn&rsquo;t really hold up to logical scrutiny.  Sure, a sale of a used game does not directly support the game&rsquo;s publisher and developer, but there&rsquo;s no guarantee that the buyer would otherwise have bought the game new.  More importantly, the person who traded in that game for store credit is likely to use that credit toward the purchase of a new game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Triple-A&rdquo; retail games cost $60 in the US and Canada these days, and in countries like Australia prices can reach AUS $100 and above.  That is, frankly, an absurd amount of money and out of the reach of a great many people.  Without a healthy used market to mitigate these prices, many consumers would simply be forced to purchase fewer games.  Others would likely turn to piracy.  Nobody wins in that scenario; not developers, not publishers, and certainly not gamers.</p>

<p>My arguments thus far have been based on assumptions and logic rather than empirical data, just as the arguments I am attacking are.  What I am postulating is that my analysis is at least as plausible as the alternative (in my opinion, moreso), and that in the absence of actual scientific data the sane solution for publishers is to try to compete with used sales by offering better service and pricing incentives rather than trying to find technological solutions which, even when well-meaning, embitter those who can&rsquo;t afford to buy every game they are interested in at $60 a pop.</p>

<p>Now, you might be thinking that because I&rsquo;m not in the industry, my perspective is limited.  Maybe publishers <em>do</em> have data which support the conclusion that used game sales are a net loss.  It&rsquo;s possible; it certainly makes sense that entities which exist solely to maximize game sales would want to have that data.  That said, given the ineptitude displayed by media giants in fighting piracy, I am not convinced that it should be taken for granted that they take a scientific approach to <em>anything</em>.  Take this exchange between <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kristen_">Kristen Bornemann</a> and I on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kristen_"><strong>@kristen_</strong></a>: <a
href="https://twitter.com/#!/cwgabriel">@cwgabriel</a> When people pick up used
games it reduces the chance of publishers investing more money into the game
(sequel, etc).<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kristen_"><strong>@kristen_</strong></a>: <a
href="https://twitter.com/#!/cwgabriel">@cwgabriel</a> Therefore it directly
hurts us as devs… especially 3rd party devs.<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lindgrenM"><strong>@lindgrenM</strong></a>: <a
href="https://twitter.com/#!/kristen_">@kristen_</a> Do you have statistics that
demonstrate that, or are you just assuming so by the false equivalency of 1 used
sale = 1 lost sale?<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kristen_"><strong>@kristen_</strong></a>: <a
href="https://twitter.com/#!/lindgrenM">@lindgrenM</a> I worked in publishing.
The fact is if a publisher hears that used sales are high = death for game. They
don&#8217;t care about stats.<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lindgrenM"><strong>@lindgrenM</strong></a>: <a
href="https://twitter.com/#!/kristen_">@kristen_</a> Then perhaps the community
should focus on fixing that, rather than limiting consumer choice? <br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lindgrenM"><strong>@lindgrenM</strong></a>: <a
href="https://twitter.com/#!/kristen_">@kristen_</a> Because if the publishers
&#8220;don&#8217;t care about stats,&#8221; what are their business decisions based on?
Vindictiveness? <br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kristen_"><strong>@kristen_</strong></a>: <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lindgrenM">@lindgrenM</a> hearsay and gut/instinct… why do you think I left? ;)
</blockquote>


<p>I&rsquo;m aware that this short Twitter exchange is by no means a definitive example of how every publisher everywhere conducts business.  Again, I&rsquo;m simply saying that until I see data which actually show a net loss for publishers and developers from used sales, I see no reason to take as gospel the assertion that they <em>are</em> a net loss.  That said, even if conclusive data were available, I still don&rsquo;t think I could support online passes at the conceptual level.  <em>Amalur</em> is innocuous, but it&rsquo;s the exception rather than the rule; most online passes lock used buyers out of multiplayer until they&rsquo;ve shelled out another ten to fifteen dollars.  That is blatantly vindictive anti-consumer behaviour on the part of publishers, and it epitomizes the troubling trend of media companies punishing legitimate consumers in a misguided attempt to artificially control the marketplace and perpetuate outdated business models.  For an example of exactly how far this thinking goes, consider <a href="http://altdevblogaday.com/2012/02/02/i-feel-used/" title="I Feel Used">this post</a> by Jameson Durall of Volition:</p>

<blockquote>There’s another big rumor about the next Xbox console that could really start to shake things up…it won’t play used games at all!  Personally I think this would be a fantastic change for our business and even though the consumers would be up in arms about it at first…they will grow to understand why and that it won’t kill them.</blockquote>


<p>To say that entirely removing the used market &ldquo;won&rsquo;t kill&rdquo; consumers strikes me as extremely ironic.  Used games have existed for as long as games have existed, and have evidently not killed the industry, and yet that is exactly what developers and publishers are complaining will happen if we continue with the status quo.  Durall himself says that used game sales are &ldquo;making it more and more difficult for us to continue making higher quality products.&rdquo;  My feeling is that the rhetoric is a lot more emotionally charged on the part of online pass supporters; there is a strong insinuation that used buyers are costing people their jobs and are in some sense morally inferior to those who have the luxury of being able to buy only new games.</p>

<p>But I digress.  I don&rsquo;t give too much credence to the rumor Durall refers to, but the idea that anyone would consider it a good course of action is mind boggling to me.  It&rsquo;s another step in the march towards the complete erosion of consumer rights, and along the way the products we purchase are further crippled and devalued.  It hurts consumers and it hurts content producers because <em>this devaluation of legitimate products is what drives growth in piracy.</em></p>

<p>I must clarify exactly what I mean when I say that product devaluation drives growth in piracy.  It is a popular belief among technology writers on the Internet that services which compete on convenience, such as iTunes and Steam, can actually reduce piracy.  The data that I have seen do not support that conclusion.  However, history has demonstrated that a legislative or technical solution is likely impossible because pirates will always find ways to break digital locks and make enforcement of anti-piracy legislation effectively impossible.  Any legislative solution broad enough to admit the possibility of significantly decreasing piracy by inconveniencing would-be pirates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act" title="Wikipedia: Stop Online Piracy Act">would likely have negative repercussions outweighing the benefits</a>, and the assumption that a nuking-the-anthill style solution &agrave; la <acronym title="Stop Online Piracy Act">SOPA</acronym> would be effective for more than a few weeks is <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hnifiobpjihmmjgiokkaalgomddebhng/details">extremely dubious anyway.</a></p>

<p>So what are content producers to do?  Pandora&rsquo;s Box has been opened and the clock cannot be turned back.  There will always be people with no compunction about downloading works without even attempting to compensate the artist, and dishearteningly, the research I have read indicates that once someone is turned on to piracy he is unlikely to stop&mdash;even if content producers then offer better incentives to compete with pirates.  It <a href="http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1056&context=heinzworks" title="Converting Pirates without Cannibalizing Purchasers:  The Impact of Digital Distribution on Physical Sales and Internet Piracy">has been demonstrated</a>, however, that removing options increases piracy.  Devaluing products and services with arbitrary restrictions and inconveniencing legitimate consumers will have the same effect.  <em>Copying is the fundamental operation on which the principle of computing is built.  It cannot be stopped.  The only thing content producers can do is to prevent people from turning to piracy in the first place by offering the best service possible.</em></p>

<p>Returning to the topic at hand, online passes go hand in hand with the consumer-as-enemy mindset that plagues media giants.  They arise from the same attitude that justifies $30 BluRay movies with minutes and minutes of unskippable commercials, and <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/drm-fun-several-legit-ubisoft-games-will-break-next-week-220948.phtml" title="DRM Fun: Several legit Ubisoft games will break next week - Destructoid">always-on DRM which prevents legitimate purchasers from playing single-player games</a> when the publisher&rsquo;s servers are down.  Through legislation and technology, these companies are trying to make ownership rights exclusive to corporations and prevent consumers from interacting with the media they purchase in any manner that is not explicitly pre-approved.  They are declaring a war on their customers, and it is a war they cannot win.  Make no mistake, though: as these behemoths run themselves into the ground because they are incapable of adapting, there will be casualties among the artists, musicians and developers who create the works of culture we love.</p>

<p>That is why I cannot support online passes.  I truly believe that in the long run they are detrimental to all involved.  I truly believe that the best way for a company to protect its interests is to do its utmost to reward its fans and give them the best experience possible&mdash;all of them, even those who do not <em>directly</em> contribute to the bottom line.</p>

    <id>http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2011/12/31/2010-and-2011-in-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;ll forgive me for &ldquo;metablogging,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve been ruminating lately on the purpose of this website.  Up until now, I&rsquo;ve been trying to focus exclusively on technology, programming and game design, and to minimize the subjective aspects of my connection to those fields.  Put more simply, I&rsquo;ve been avoiding writing about who I am and what I do in favour of producing a series of mostly impersonal tutorials and critiques of technology.  There are a number of reasons for this—the word &ldquo;professionalism&rdquo; comes to mind as chief among them.  I&rsquo;d like this website to be my public face on the Internet, and as every saavy Internet denizen should know by now, there are certain risks associated with maintaining a public persona.  I greatly admire <a href="http://zedshaw.com/">Zed Shaw</a>, for his personality as well as his technical accomplishments, but I have no desire to make myself unemployable as he claims to have done (albeit temporarily).</p>

<p>That said, trying to take a dry, detached and objective approach to creating a personal website presents a number of problems itself.  First and foremost, it&rsquo;s an inherent contradiction; if I don&rsquo;t write about myself in any meaningful capacity, then there is nothing aside from the superficial about this website which makes it mine.  I can&rsquo;t imagine it makes for a very interesting read, either.  Realistically, how many people will come here looking for <a title="How to link GLUT in Qt Creator on OS X" href="http://www.mlindgren.ca/archives/453">advice on how to link GLUT?</a>  Readership numbers are of little to no concern to me, mind you, but I can at least endeavour to give this website a purposeful existence.  To that end, I want to start writing more about personal topics, although for the sake of cohesiveness I&rsquo;m going to continue to focus primarily on those aspects of my life that will be of interest to a technically-minded audience.<!-- more --></p>

<p>As a start, I think that this is a good time to reflect on what I&rsquo;ve done since I started this blog in May of 2010.  Early in May, I moved to Calgary, Alberta, to start a sixteen-month internship with <a href="http://pason.com/">Pason Systems Corporation.</a>  Pason is the market-leading provider of oil rig instrumentation and service, with a wide variety of tools and technology available to facilitate safety and improve efficiency on oil rigs.  All of Pason&rsquo;s rig-site hardware and software is designed in house, but my work was on an internal web application designed to support Pason&rsquo;s most valuable employees: the field technicians who directly provide services and equipment to customers.</p>

<p>For obvious reasons, I can&rsquo;t go into great detail about the work I did at Pason.  I will say, though, that it was extremely rewarding.  I had the opportunity to work alongside some of the smartest developers I&rsquo;ve ever met, and I was able to do work that I felt had a tangible, significant and lasting impact on my team&rsquo;s product. That&rsquo;s a rare honor for an intern!  From a technical perspective, I got to work with some interesting and unfamiliar technologies; I did extensive development in Python, created rich user experiences with HTML5 and JavaScript, and dabbled with C# when the need arose.  The whole experience was hugely instructive, and I will always fondly remember my time at Pason.  Of my entire education, my internship is without a doubt the part that I value most.</p>

<p>In September of this year, I moved back to Edmonton to finish my Computing Science degree at the University of Alberta.  It being my final year and with most of my specific course requirements out of the way, I loaded up on computing science courses, which led to a fairly engaging but difficult semester.  Among the courses I took were Advanced Games Programming in C++, Compiler Design, and Introduction to Computer Graphics.</p>

<p>As a term project for the Advanced Games Programming course, I undertook a modification of the <a href="http://skatgame.net/mburo/orts/" target="_blank">ORTS</a> game engine to allow user interface scripting with Lua, à la World of Warcraft.  I feel that the outcome of this project was a little underwhelming, as limited time and the complexity of ORTS forced me to settle for less comprehensive scripting capabilities than I would have liked.  Nevertheless, I learned a great deal about Lua and the process of interfacing with Lua from C++. I think I now have an inkling of what&rsquo;s involved in creating a robust client-side scripting system as in World of Warcraft, or even a custom development platform like <a title="Ansca Mobile Corona" href="http://www.anscamobile.com/corona/" target="_blank">Corona</a>.  Given the popularity of Lua as a scripting language in game development and my interest in developing games, I&rsquo;m sure it will be valuable experience.</p>

<p>Although I believe I would be within my academic rights to do so, for the time being I don&rsquo;t foresee myself releasing the source code for my Advanced Games Programming project.  ORTS has not seen active development in a number of years, so it is outdated and difficult to compile and run, let alone modify.  Additionally, my own work—being a school project as it is—would probably not prove to be a good demonstration of Lua/C++ integration best practices, and I&rsquo;m always wary of releasing code from which others might learn the wrong way of doing things.  I do have a report on the project which I&rsquo;d like to reproduce here at some point, though.  </p>

<p>For University of Alberta Computing Science students, I have some advice which I&rsquo;d like to share regarding the Advanced Games Programming course.  If you already know C++, as I did, I would have to recommend against taking it.  Much to my chagrin, the majority of the lectures were actually about C++ in and of itself, rather than algorithms and techniques relevant to games.  It certainly would be helpful for anyone who wants to pick up C++, but if you&rsquo;re looking for a thorough examination of game programming, look elsewhere.</p>

<p>Compilers was perhaps my favorite course of the semester, although it was also by far the most difficult.  I would describe it as a strangely paradoxical course.  The theory behind formal languages, parsing and code generation is not extremely complex, but it can be initially hard to grasp, as it is very heavy on jargon and has numerous rules and axioms to memorize.  The process of building a <em>simple</em> compiler for a simple language is, in retrospect, fairly mechanical and manageable, but it seems anything but when approached without the benefit of hindsight.  Overall, the course is just a staggering amount of work, but it is also among the most rewarding courses I&rsquo;ve taken.</p>

<p>Finally, Introduction to Computer Graphics, I got to expand upon the OpenGL knowledge I had built during the development of <a title="Puzzle Panel" href="http://www.mlindgren.ca/projects/puzzle-panel">my iOS game</a>, while also learning the fundamental aspects of computer graphics.  Like Compilers, Graphics is a challenging but rewarding course, one of the most difficult aspects of it being the time commitment required.  (Of course, it is also fairly math-heavy.)  As someone who appreciates the beauty of a well-designed, simple algorithm, I found that learning about such achievements as the <a title="Wikipedia: Midpoint circle algorithm" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint_circle_algorithm" target="_blank">midpoint circle algorithm</a> was one of the most enjoyable aspects of the course.  I feel that there&rsquo;s an almost Zen-like quality to a clever but simple algorithm which strips away preconceptions of complexity to accomplish a task in the most efficient manner possible.  If you&rsquo;re of a similar mind, graphics is full of examples of such algorithms.  Of course, working in graphics is also rewarding for its ability to produce visually interesting results, which is a rare treat in academic computing science:</p>

<div style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Shadow volumes" src="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/images/shadowvolumes.jpg" alt="A demonstration of shadow volumes from an Introduction to Computer Graphics assignment" width="386" height="335" /><em><small>A demonstration of shadow volumes from an Introduction to Computer Graphics assignment.</small></em></div>


<p>2010 and 2011 were exciting years for me, and although I&rsquo;m not ready to discuss it yet, I have something huge lined up for after I graduate in April of 2012. In the meantime, I&rsquo;ll continue to post here as often as I can manage. Thanks for reading, and happy new year!</p>

    <id>http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2011/12/30/ethical-game-design-from-gamasutra</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I came across a couple excellent articles on Gamasutra which I want to share here. The first, &ldquo;<a title="Contrivance and Extortion: In-App Purchases &amp; Microtransactions" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AdamSaltsman/20111018/8685/Contrivance_and_Extortion_InApp_Purchases__Microtransactions.php">Contrivance and Extortion: In-App Purchases &amp; Microtransactions</a>&rdquo; is by <a href="http://adamatomic.com/" target="_blank">Adam Saltsman</a>, creator of Canabalt, among other games. He argues that in-app purchases and so-called microtransactions are being abused by some game developers, &ldquo;deliberately contriving their designs in the worst way in order to extort money from players, which is unethical and unacceptable design practice.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll lay my cards on the table and say that I am in complete agreement with Adam.  As he does in his <a title="Contrivance and Extortion II: Clarifications, Feedback &amp; Suggestions" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AdamSaltsman/20111020/8703/Contrivance_and_Extortion_II_Clarifications_Feedback__Suggestions.php">explanatory follow-up</a>, I acknowledge that there are benefits to the &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; model, but the techniques commonly associated with that model are often used in a cynical, manipulative and profit-driven manner which I feel is harmful to consumers and the industry. Whether or not you agree, Adam&rsquo;s thoughts on the subject are certainly worth reading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<a title="Radical Plagiarism: The Ethical Lessons of the Gamenauts Controversy" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/EvanJones/20110815/8195/Radical_Plagiarism_The_Ethical_Lessons_of_the_Gamenauts_Controversy.php" target="_blank">Radical Plagiarism: The Ethical Lessons of the Gamenauts Controversy</a>,&rdquo; by <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/author/EvanJones/4235/">Evan Jones</a>, is equally thought-provoking. Evan recounts the cloning of the indie game <a href="http://www.bored.com/game/play/150995/Radical_Fishing.html"><em>Radical Fishing</em></a> by the more established indie studio <a href="http://gamenauts.com/">Gamenauts</a>, and adds his perspective on the cultural impact of the rampant cloning that takes place on mobile app stores. Returning readers may recall that I&rsquo;ve previously <a title="In Defense of Clones" href="http://www.mlindgren.ca/archives/318">defended the practice of cloning games</a>. My defense excluded the cloning of smaller titles by established studios, which I&rsquo;ve always viewed as morally questionable at best, but Evan&rsquo;s article nevertheless gave me pause. He provides a strong counterpoint to my own thinking on the matter, and while I&rsquo;m not yet ready to reverse my position, his argument has undeniable weight. If you&rsquo;re at all interested in game development, both articles are well worth your time.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2011/09/21/how-to-link-glut-in-qt-creator-on-os-x/"/>
    <updated>2011-09-21T00:34:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2011/09/21/how-to-link-glut-in-qt-creator-on-os-x</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This tutorial is for an extremely specific and possibly unusual set of circumstances, but I&rsquo;m hoping that it will prove useful to someone. For one of my courses this term, we&rsquo;re building OpenGL apps using Nokia&rsquo;s open source Qt framework. Qt provides some very nice scaffolding, and the Qt Creator IDE is among the best I&rsquo;ve used, although I imagine it lacks flexibility for general-purpose applications—that is, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t use it to build non-Qt applications. Qt also allows one to easily write cross-platform C++ GUI applications. That said, linking procedures can be a bit different on different platforms, and as a beginner it&rsquo;s not always immediately obvious how instructions for Windows development translate into other environments.</p>

<p>In particular, I found myself having difficulty linking the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) with my project on Mac OS X. After much Googling and some frustration, I came up with the correct way to go about it, which is as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li>In Qt Creator, open your project file (.pro) in the text editor.  Right click on the text editor pane and select &#8220;Add Library&#8230;&#8221;</li>
    <li>Chose &#8220;System Library.&#8221;</li>
    <li>Locate the GLUT framework.  On my Mac, running Lion, I used <code>/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/GLUT.framework</code>. However, it seems there are multiple different copies on the disk that you could use.  If that path doesn&#8217;t work for you, just search for <code>glut.h</code> in Finder and you&#8217;ll find a copy of the framework.  The path you enter into Qt Creator should point to a <code>.framework</code> directory.</li>
    <li>Qt Creator will generate code in your project file which will link to the correct framework or library depending on which platform the code is being compiled on.</li>
    <li>Finally, because Apple loves to be different, the glut.h header path is different on OS X.  <strong>You&#8217;ll need to <code>#include &lt;GLUT/glut.h&gt;</code></strong>, instead of <code>&lt;gl/glut.h&gt;</code> is usually the case.  You can use preprocessor conditional statements to make this inclusion cross-platform:
<pre>#if defined(__APPLE__) || defined(MACOSX)
  #include &lt;GLUT/glut.h&gt;
#else
  #include &lt;gl/glut.h&gt;
#endif</pre>
</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s it! If you have any trouble, leave a comment.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2011/09/21/how-to-reinstall-os-x-from-a-disc-image-using-only-one-computer/"/>
    <updated>2011-09-21T00:17:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2011/09/21/how-to-reinstall-os-x-from-a-disc-image-using-only-one-computer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My internship recently ended, and as such, I had to move from Calgary back to Edmonton, where I&rsquo;ll be completing the fourth year of my Computing Science degree at the University of Alberta. I hope to be able to write more about my internship later, but at the moment I want to share a handy trick I discovered for reinstalling OS X. The reason I bring up the move is that after I arrived in Edmonton, I found myself wanting to reformat my Mac Mini and re-install Snow Leopard, but my Snow Leopard disc was nowhere to be found. Luckily, as a semi-paranoid computer scientist with an abundance of disk space, I keep images of important discs on my network-attached storage device for just such occasions.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, the Snow Leopard disc image is large enough that it can only be burned to a dual-layer DVD. I don&rsquo;t tend to keep writeable dual-layer DVDs lying around, so I needed a solution which required only the disc image itself. There are a number of methods available for installing OS X over the network, but none of them seemed to work for me—perhaps owing to the fact that I had only one Mac. Luckily, I discovered that you can install OS X from a separate partition on the same disk. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>

<ol>
    <li>First, you&#8217;ll need to re-partition your disk. Open Disk Utility and select the disk you want to use. Be sure to select the disk itself, rather than one of its partitions, which are indented beneath the disk.</li>
    <li>Click the + button to add a new partition, and drag the new partition&#8217;s section in the disk layout graph upwards until it&#8217;s large enough to store your operating system disc image. Apply the changes. It may take some time for the disk to be re-partitioned.</li>
    <li>Now, select the new partition from the list on the left. Go to the Restore tab, and restore your operating system disc image to the new partition.</li>
    <li>Once the restore is complete, restart your computer, holding Option (Alt) at start-up. This should bring up a list of available start-up disks. Choose your new partition.</li>

</ol>
