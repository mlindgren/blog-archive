  <div class="entry-content"><p>Online passes are becoming more and more ubiquitous in the games industry.  For those who aren&#8217;t familiar with the terminology, an online pass is essentially a form of digital rights management designed to discourage and devalue used game sales by tying some game content to unique, one-use codes packaged with new copies of games.  Online passes are a contentious issue.  Some feel that they&#8217;re a perfectly legitimate way for developers and publishers to ensure that they get their cut of each sale, and to reward those who purchase games new.  Others see them as a violation of consumer rights or contend that they inconvenience customers who <em>do</em> buy new (by requiring them to type in long access codes on game controllers) while being of only dubious value to publishers and developers.</p>

<p>Most recently, there&#8217;s been a bit of an uproar over the inclusion of an online pass in <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdoms_of_Amalur:_Reckoning">Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning</a></em>, a single-player RPG with no online component.  The pass confers seven extra quests on those who purchase the game new, or deprives those who purchased used of them, depending on your perspective.<!--more-->  Before I lay my cards on the table, I&#8217;ll let Curt Schilling, the founder of the studio behind the game, explain what he sees the purpose of the online pass as:</p>

<blockquote>That being said, this next part is likely to piss people off, but it&#8217;s a truth and it&#8217;s how I feel. You can argue the merits and effectiveness of it, but right now it&#8217;s how it&#8217;s done and as someone that&#8217;s as invested as I am in this company, I stand by what has happened.

DAY 1 DLC, to be extremely and VIVIDLY clear, is FREE, 100% totally FREE, to anyone that buys a new copy of Reckoning, ANYONE. 

If you don&#8217;t buy new games you buy them used, and in that case you will have to pay for the Day 1 free DLC content the new copy buyers got for free.

It&#8217;s clear the intent right? To promote early adopters and MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO ME, REWARD fans and gamers who commit to us with their time and money when it benefits the company.</blockquote>


<p>You can read the rest of his post <a href="http://forums.reckoning.amalur.com/showthread.php?3063-Did-you-push-back-at-EA-at-all-over-this-Quest-content-gated-by-online-pass.&s=2ba8c3194088140ce6161b0c374691f5&p=52812&viewfull=1#post52812" title="Curt Schilling's post on the Kingdoms of Amalur online pass.">on the Kingdoms of Amalur forum.</a>  I think Curt&#8217;s position is reasonable and I am sympathetic to the frustration he&#8217;s clearly feeling; he believes that he&#8217;s trying to protect his business interests and in the process rewarding loyal fans with free bonus content, and receiving nothing but scorn in return.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think <em>Kingdoms of Amalur</em>&#8217;s online pass is an egregious abuse by any means, but in general,  I do count myself among those who see online passes as an unsettling trend.  I think consumers have good reason to be suspicious of companies that choose to use online passes.  There are good arguments for and against online passes, but the most popular arguments in favor of online passes often seem to rely on strawmen and dubious assumptions with no supporting data.  Jerry Holkins (Tycho) of Penny Arcade <a href="http://penny-arcade.com/2012/01/30/plurality" title="Plurality - Penny Arcade">writes:</a></p>

<blockquote>I&#8217;ve been reading a lot his weekend about Fat Cats and how fat they are and how they want your money, but the only choice you get in this matter (aside from the wholly valid &#8220;not buying it&#8221; choice, of course) is which supposed Fat Cat to enrich.  You can enrich the people who made the game you are enjoying, or you can enrich people who had nothing to do with the game.  Policies like this are designed to incentivize new purchases: that is to say, sales.  We call those sales.</blockquote>


<p>In other words, you&#8217;re either supporting the developers who produce the games you love, or you&#8217;re supporting retailers like Gamestop.  Naturally most consumers would prefer the former, all else being equal; developers are creative entities, focused&mdash;or so we can hope&mdash;on artistic expression before profit.  Retailers, by contrast, are often viewed as greedy and incidental vestiges of the rapidly dying era of physical media.  Their services are at best unnecessary, and at worst <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2011/08/24/gamestop-intentionally-removing-deus-ex-onlive-coupons-from-reta/" title="Gamestop intentionally removing Deus Ex OnLive coupons from retail PC copies - Joystiq">abusive of their customers to an extent that would make an ardent objectivist blush.</a></p>

<p>This is a false dichotomy for two reasons.  First, traditional retailers are not the only avenues for the trading and selling of used games.  One could trade games directly with friends or colleagues, or buy and sell them at garage sales and flea markets.  There are even a number of online services that have been created for the explicit purpose of allowing consumers to trade and sell used games at reasonable prices.  (Of course, those services take a cut too, but I think it&#8217;s safe to assume that their margins are nothing like Gamestop&#8217;s, and they are much more consumer-centric in general.)</p>

<p>More importantly, there is an implicit assumption in Holkins&#8217; argument that each used sale deprives the publisher of a new sale.  This is the same false equivalency that the <acronym title="Motion Picture Association of America">MPAA</acronym> and <acronym title="Recording Industry Association of America">RIAA</acronym> have been using for years to <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/223431/riaa_thinks_limewire_owes_75_trillion_in_damages.html" title="RIAA thinks Limewire owes $75 trillion in damages" target="_blank">overstate the negative effects of piracy</a>, and it is no less pernicious when applied to secondhand markets.  To the best of my knowledge there is absolutely no data to support this assertion, and it doesn&#8217;t really hold up to logical scrutiny.  Sure, a sale of a used game does not directly support the game&#8217;s publisher and developer, but there&#8217;s no guarantee that the buyer would otherwise have bought the game new.  More importantly, the person who traded in that game for store credit is likely to use that credit toward the purchase of a new game.</p>

<p>&#8220;Triple-A&#8221; retail games cost $60 in the US and Canada these days, and in countries like Australia prices can reach AUS $100 and above.  That is, frankly, an absurd amount of money and out of the reach of a great many people.  Without a healthy used market to mitigate these prices, many consumers would simply be forced to purchase fewer games.  Others would likely turn to piracy.  Nobody wins in that scenario; not developers, not publishers, and certainly not gamers.</p>

<p>My arguments thus far have been based on assumptions and logic rather than empirical data, just as the arguments I am attacking are.  What I am postulating is that my analysis is at least as plausible as the alternative (in my opinion, moreso), and that in the absence of actual scientific data the sane solution for publishers is to try to compete with used sales by offering better service and pricing incentives rather than trying to find technological solutions which, even when well-meaning, embitter those who can&#8217;t afford to buy every game they are interested in at $60 a pop.</p>

<p>Now, you might be thinking that because I&#8217;m not in the industry, my perspective is limited.  Maybe publishers <em>do</em> have data which support the conclusion that used game sales are a net loss.  It&#8217;s possible; it certainly makes sense that entities which exist solely to maximize game sales would want to have that data.  That said, given the ineptitude displayed by media giants in fighting piracy, I am not convinced that it should be taken for granted that they take a scientific approach to <em>anything</em>.  Take this exchange between <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kristen_">Kristen Bornemann</a> and I on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kristen_"><strong>@kristen_</strong></a>: <a

<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kristen_"><strong>@kristen_</strong></a>: <a

<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lindgrenM"><strong>@lindgrenM</strong></a>: <a

<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kristen_"><strong>@kristen_</strong></a>: <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lindgrenM">@lindgrenM</a> hearsay and gut/instinctâ¦ why do you think I left? ;)
</blockquote>


<p>I&#8217;m aware that this short Twitter exchange is by no means a definitive example of how every publisher everywhere conducts business.  Again, I&#8217;m simply saying that until I see data which actually show a net loss for publishers and developers from used sales, I see no reason to take as gospel the assertion that they <em>are</em> a net loss.  That said, even if conclusive data were available, I still don&#8217;t think I could support online passes at the conceptual level.  <em>Amalur</em> is innocuous, but it&#8217;s the exception rather than the rule; most online passes lock used buyers out of multiplayer until they&#8217;ve shelled out another ten to fifteen dollars.  That is blatantly vindictive anti-consumer behaviour on the part of publishers, and it epitomizes the troubling trend of media companies punishing legitimate consumers in a misguided attempt to artificially control the marketplace and perpetuate outdated business models.  For an example of exactly how far this thinking goes, consider <a href="http://altdevblogaday.com/2012/02/02/i-feel-used/" title="I Feel Used">this post</a> by Jameson Durall of Volition:</p>

<blockquote>Thereâs another big rumor about the next Xbox console that could really start to shake things upâ¦it wonât play used games at all!  Personally I think this would be a fantastic change for our business and even though the consumers would be up in arms about it at firstâ¦they will grow to understand why and that it wonât kill them.</blockquote>


<p>To say that entirely removing the used market &#8220;won&#8217;t kill&#8221; consumers strikes me as extremely ironic.  Used games have existed for as long as games have existed, and have evidently not killed the industry, and yet that is exactly what developers and publishers are complaining will happen if we continue with the status quo.  Durall himself says that used game sales are &#8220;making it more and more difficult for us to continue making higher quality products.&#8221;  My feeling is that the rhetoric is a lot more emotionally charged on the part of online pass supporters; there is a strong insinuation that used buyers are costing people their jobs and are in some sense morally inferior to those who have the luxury of being able to buy only new games.</p>

<p>But I digress.  I don&#8217;t give too much credence to the rumor Durall refers to, but the idea that anyone would consider it a good course of action is mind boggling to me.  It&#8217;s another step in the march towards the complete erosion of consumer rights, and along the way the products we purchase are further crippled and devalued.  It hurts consumers and it hurts content producers because <em>this devaluation of legitimate products is what drives growth in piracy.</em></p>

<p>I must clarify exactly what I mean when I say that product devaluation drives growth in piracy.  It is a popular belief among technology writers on the Internet that services which compete on convenience, such as iTunes and Steam, can actually reduce piracy.  The data that I have seen do not support that conclusion.  However, history has demonstrated that a legislative or technical solution is likely impossible because pirates will always find ways to break digital locks and make enforcement of anti-piracy legislation effectively impossible.  Any legislative solution broad enough to admit the possibility of significantly decreasing piracy by inconveniencing would-be pirates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act" title="Wikipedia: Stop Online Piracy Act">would likely have negative repercussions outweighing the benefits</a>, and the assumption that a nuking-the-anthill style solution &agrave; la <acronym title="Stop Online Piracy Act">SOPA</acronym> would be effective for more than a few weeks is <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hnifiobpjihmmjgiokkaalgomddebhng/details">extremely dubious anyway.</a></p>

<p>So what are content producers to do?  Pandora&#8217;s Box has been opened and the clock cannot be turned back.  There will always be people with no compunction about downloading works without even attempting to compensate the artist, and dishearteningly, the research I have read indicates that once someone is turned on to piracy he is unlikely to stop&mdash;even if content producers then offer better incentives to compete with pirates.  It <a href="http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1056&context=heinzworks" title="Converting Pirates without Cannibalizing Purchasers:  The Impact of Digital Distribution on Physical Sales and Internet Piracy">has been demonstrated</a>, however, that removing options increases piracy.  Devaluing products and services with arbitrary restrictions and inconveniencing legitimate consumers will have the same effect.  <em>Copying is the fundamental operation on which the principle of computing is built.  It cannot be stopped.  The only thing content producers can do is to prevent people from turning to piracy in the first place by offering the best service possible.</em></p>

<p>Returning to the topic at hand, online passes go hand in hand with the consumer-as-enemy mindset that plagues media giants.  They arise from the same attitude that justifies $30 BluRay movies with minutes and minutes of unskippable commercials, and <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/drm-fun-several-legit-ubisoft-games-will-break-next-week-220948.phtml" title="DRM Fun: Several legit Ubisoft games will break next week - Destructoid">always-on DRM which prevents legitimate purchasers from playing single-player games</a> when the publisher&#8217;s servers are down.  Through legislation and technology, these companies are trying to make ownership rights exclusive to corporations and prevent consumers from interacting with the media they purchase in any manner that is not explicitly pre-approved.  They are declaring a war on their customers, and it is a war they cannot win.  Make no mistake, though: as these behemoths run themselves into the ground because they are incapable of adapting, there will be casualties among the artists, musicians and developers who create the works of culture we love.</p>

<p>That is why I cannot support online passes.  I truly believe that in the long run they are detrimental to all involved.  I truly believe that the best way for a company to protect its interests is to do its utmost to reward its fans and give them the best experience possible&mdash;all of them, even those who do not <em>directly</em> contribute to the bottom line.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;ll forgive me for &#8220;metablogging,&#8221; I&#8217;ve been ruminating lately on the purpose of this website. Â Up until now, I&#8217;ve been trying to focus exclusively on technology, programming and game design, and to minimize the subjective aspects of my connection to those fields. Â Put more simply, I&#8217;ve been avoiding writing about who I am and what I do in favour of producing a series of mostly impersonal tutorials and critiques of technology. Â There are a number of reasons for thisâthe word &#8220;professionalism&#8221; comes to mind as chief among them. Â I&#8217;d like this website to be my public face on the Internet, and as every saavy Internet denizen should know by now, there are certain risks associated with maintaining a public persona. Â I greatly admire <a href="http://zedshaw.com/">Zed Shaw</a>, for his personality as well as his technical accomplishments, but I have no desire to make myself unemployable as he claims to have done (albeit temporarily).</p>

<p>That said, trying to take a dry, detached and objective approach to creating a personal website presents a number of problems itself. Â First and foremost, it&#8217;s an inherent contradiction; if I don&#8217;t write about myself in any meaningful capacity, then there is nothing aside from the superficial about this website which makes it mine. Â I can&#8217;t imagine it makes for a very interesting read, either. Â Realistically, how many people will come here looking for <a title="How to link GLUT in Qt Creator on OS X" href="http://www.mlindgren.ca/archives/453">advice on how to link GLUT?</a>Â  Readership numbers are of little to no concern to me, mind you, but I can at least endeavour to give this website a purposeful existence. Â To that end, I want to start writing more about personal topics, although for the sake of cohesiveness I&#8217;m going to continue to focus primarily on those aspects of my life that will be of interest to a technically-minded audience.<!--more--></p>

<p>As a start, I think that this is a good time to reflect on what I&#8217;ve done since I started this blog in May of 2010. Â Early in May, I moved to Calgary, Alberta, to start a sixteen-month internship with <a href="http://pason.com/">Pason Systems Corporation.</a>Â  Pason is the market-leading provider of oil rig instrumentation and service, with a wide variety of tools and technology available to facilitate safety and improve efficiency on oil rigs. Â All of Pason&#8217;s rig-site hardware and software is designed in house, but my work was on an internal web application designed to support Pason&#8217;s most valuable employees: the field technicians who directly provide services and equipment to customers.</p>

<p>For obvious reasons, I can&#8217;t go into great detail about the work I did at Pason. Â I will say, though, that it was extremely rewarding. Â I had the opportunity to work alongside some of the smartest developers I&#8217;ve ever met, and I was able to do work that I felt had a tangible, significant and lasting impact on my team&#8217;s product. That&#8217;s a rare honor for an intern! Â From a technical perspective, I got to work with some interesting and unfamiliar technologies; I did extensive development in Python, created rich user experiences with HTML5 and JavaScript, and dabbled with C# when the need arose. Â The whole experience was hugely instructive, and I will always fondly remember my time at Pason. Â Of my entire education, my internship is without a doubt the part that I value most.</p>

<p>In September of this year, I moved back to Edmonton to finish my Computing Science degree at the University of Alberta. Â It being my final year and with most of my specific course requirements out of the way, I loaded up on computing science courses, which led to a fairly engaging but difficult semester. Â Among the courses I took were Advanced Games Programming in C++, Compiler Design, and Introduction to Computer Graphics.</p>

<p>As a term project for the Advanced Games Programming course, I undertook a modification of the <a href="http://skatgame.net/mburo/orts/" target="_blank">ORTS</a> game engine to allow user interface scripting with Lua, Ã  la World of Warcraft. Â I feel that the outcome of this project was a little underwhelming, as limited time and the complexity of ORTS forced me to settle for less comprehensive scripting capabilities than I would have liked. Â Nevertheless, I learned a great deal about Lua and the process of interfacing with Lua from C++. I think I now have an inkling of what&#8217;s involved in creating a robust client-side scripting system as in World of Warcraft, or even a custom development platform like <a title="Ansca Mobile Corona" href="http://www.anscamobile.com/corona/" target="_blank">Corona</a>. Â Given the popularity of Lua as a scripting language in game development and my interest in developing games, I&#8217;m sure it will be valuable experience.</p>

<p>Although I believe I would be within my academic rights to do so, for the time being I don&#8217;t foresee myself releasing the source code for my Advanced Games Programming project. Â ORTS has not seen active development in a number of years, so it is outdated and difficult to compile and run, let alone modify. Â Additionally, my own workâbeing a school project as it isâwould probably not prove to be a good demonstration of Lua/C++ integration best practices, and I&#8217;m always wary of releasing code from which others might learn the wrong way of doing things. Â I do have a report on the project which I&#8217;d like to reproduce here at some point, though. Â </p>

<p>For University of Alberta Computing Science students, I have some advice which I&#8217;d like to share regarding the Advanced Games Programming course.  If you already know C++, as I did, I would have to recommend against taking it. Â Much to my chagrin, the majority of the lectures were actually about C++ in and of itself, rather than algorithms and techniques relevant to games.  It certainly would be helpful for anyone who wants to pick up C++, but if you&#8217;re looking for a thorough examination of game programming, look elsewhere.</p>

<p>Compilers was perhaps my favorite course of the semester, although it was also by far the most difficult. Â I would describe it as a strangely paradoxical course. Â The theory behind formal languages, parsing and code generation is not extremely complex, but it can be initially hard to grasp, as it is very heavy on jargon and has numerous rules and axioms to memorize. Â The process of building a <em>simple</em> compiler for a simple language is, in retrospect, fairly mechanical and manageable, but it seems anything but when approached without the benefit of hindsight. Â Overall, the course is just a staggering amount of work, but it is also among the most rewarding courses I&#8217;ve taken.</p>

<p>Finally, Introduction to Computer Graphics, I got to expand upon the OpenGL knowledge I had built during the development of <a title="Puzzle Panel" href="http://www.mlindgren.ca/projects/puzzle-panel">my iOS game</a>, while also learning the fundamental aspects of computer graphics. Â Like Compilers, Graphics is a challenging but rewarding course, one of the most difficult aspects of it being the time commitment required. Â (Of course, it is also fairly math-heavy.) Â As someone who appreciates the beauty of a well-designed, simple algorithm, I found that learning about such achievements as the <a title="Wikipedia: Midpoint circle algorithm" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint_circle_algorithm" target="_blank">midpoint circle algorithm</a>Â was one of the most enjoyable aspects of the course. Â I feel that there&#8217;s an almost Zen-like quality to a clever but simple algorithm which strips away preconceptions of complexity to accomplish a task in the most efficient manner possible. Â If you&#8217;re of a similar mind, graphics is full of examples of such algorithms. Â Of course, working in graphics is also rewarding for its ability to produce visually interesting results, which is a rare treat in academic computing science:</p>

<p>2010 and 2011 were exciting years for me, and although I&#8217;m not ready to discuss it yet, I have something huge lined up for after I graduate in April of 2012. In the meantime, I&#8217;ll continue to post here as often as I can manage. Thanks for reading, and happy new year!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I came across a couple excellent articles on Gamasutra which I want to share here. The first, &#8221;<a title="Contrivance and Extortion: In-App Purchases &amp; Microtransactions" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AdamSaltsman/20111018/8685/Contrivance_and_Extortion_InApp_Purchases__Microtransactions.php">Contrivance and Extortion: In-App Purchases &amp; Microtransactions</a>&#8221; is by <a href="http://adamatomic.com/" target="_blank">Adam Saltsman</a>, creator of Canabalt, among other games. He argues that in-app purchases and so-called microtransactions are being abused by some game developers, &#8220;deliberately contriving their designs in the worst way in order to extort money from players, which is unethical and unacceptable design practice.&#8221; I&#8217;ll lay my cards on the table and say that I am in complete agreement with Adam. Â As he does in his <a title="Contrivance and Extortion II: Clarifications, Feedback &amp; Suggestions" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AdamSaltsman/20111020/8703/Contrivance_and_Extortion_II_Clarifications_Feedback__Suggestions.php">explanatory follow-up</a>, I acknowledge that there are benefits to the &#8220;freemium&#8221; model, but the techniques commonly associated with that model are often used in a cynical, manipulative and profit-driven manner which I feel is harmful to consumers and the industry. Whether or not you agree, Adam&#8217;s thoughts on the subject are certainly worth reading.</p>

<p>&#8220;<a title="Radical Plagiarism: The Ethical Lessons of the Gamenauts Controversy" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/EvanJones/20110815/8195/Radical_Plagiarism_The_Ethical_Lessons_of_the_Gamenauts_Controversy.php" target="_blank">Radical Plagiarism: The Ethical Lessons of the Gamenauts Controversy</a>,&#8221; by <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/author/EvanJones/4235/">Evan Jones</a>, is equally thought-provoking. Evan recounts the cloning of the indie game <a href="http://www.bored.com/game/play/150995/Radical_Fishing.html"><em>Radical Fishing</em></a> by the more established indie studio <a href="http://gamenauts.com/">Gamenauts</a>, and adds his perspective on the cultural impact of the rampant cloning that takes place on mobile app stores. Returning readers may recall that I&#8217;ve previously <a title="In Defense of Clones" href="http://www.mlindgren.ca/archives/318">defended the practice of cloning games</a>. My defense excluded the cloning of smaller titles by established studios, which I&#8217;ve always viewed as morally questionable at best, but Evan&#8217;s article nevertheless gave me pause. He provides a strong counterpoint to my own thinking on the matter, and while I&#8217;m not yet ready to reverse my position, his argument has undeniable weight. If you&#8217;re at all interested in game development, both articles are well worth your time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This tutorial is for an extremely specific and possibly unusual set of circumstances, but I&#8217;m hoping that it will prove useful to someone. For one of my courses this term, we&#8217;re building OpenGL apps using Nokia&#8217;s open source Qt framework. Qt provides some very nice scaffolding, and the Qt Creator IDE is among the best I&#8217;ve used, although I imagine it lacks flexibility for general-purpose applicationsâthat is, you probably wouldn&#8217;t use it to build non-Qt applications. Qt also allows one to easily write cross-platform C++ GUI applications. That said, linking procedures can be a bit different on different platforms, and as a beginner it&#8217;s not always immediately obvious how instructions for Windows development translate into other environments.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>In particular, I found myself having difficulty linking the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) with my project on Mac OS X. After much Googling and some frustration, I came up with the correct way to go about it, which is as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li>In Qt Creator, open your project file (.pro) in the text editor. Â Right click on the text editor pane and select &#8220;Add Library&#8230;&#8221;</li>
    <li>Chose &#8220;System Library.&#8221;</li>
    <li>Locate the GLUT framework. Â On my Mac, running Lion, I usedÂ <code>/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/GLUT.framework</code>. However, it seems there are multiple different copies on the disk that you could use. Â If that path doesn&#8217;t work for you, just search for <code>glut.h</code> in Finder and you&#8217;ll find a copy of the framework. Â The path you enter into Qt Creator should point to aÂ <code>.framework</code> directory.</li>
    <li>Qt Creator will generate code in your project file which will link to the correct framework or library depending on which platform the code is being compiled on.</li>
    <li>Finally, because Apple loves to be different, theÂ glut.hÂ header path is different on OS X. Â <strong>You&#8217;ll need toÂ <code>#include &lt;GLUT/glut.h&gt;</code></strong>,Â instead ofÂ <code>&lt;gl/glut.h&gt;</code>Â is usually the case. Â You can use preprocessor conditional statements to make this inclusion cross-platform:
<pre>#if defined(__APPLE__) || defined(MACOSX)
  #include &lt;GLUT/glut.h&gt;
#else
  #include &lt;gl/glut.h&gt;
#endif</pre>
</li>
</ol>


<p>That&#8217;s it! If you have any trouble, leave a comment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My internship recently ended, and as such, I had to move from Calgary back to Edmonton, where I&#8217;ll be completing the fourth year of my Computing Science degree at the University of Alberta. I hope to be able to write more about my internship later, but at the moment I want to share a handy trick I discovered for reinstalling OS X. The reason I bring up the move is that after I arrived in Edmonton, I found myself wanting to reformat my Mac Mini and re-install Snow Leopard, but my Snow Leopard disc was nowhere to be found. Luckily, as a semi-paranoid computer scientist with an abundance of disk space, I keep images of important discs on my network-attached storage device for just such occasions.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Unfortunately, however, the Snow Leopard disc image is large enough that it can only be burned to a dual-layer DVD. I don&#8217;t tend to keep writeable dual-layer DVDs lying around, so I needed a solution which required only the disc image itself. There are a number of methods available for installing OS X over the network, but none of them seemed to work for meâperhaps owing to the fact that I had only one Mac. Luckily, I discovered that you can install OS X from a separate partition on the same disk. Here&#8217;s how:</p>

<ol>
    <li>First, you&#8217;ll need to re-partition your disk. Open Disk Utility and select the disk you want to use. Be sure to select the disk itself, rather than one of its partitions, which are indented beneath the disk.</li>
    <li>Click the + button to add a new partition, and drag the new partition&#8217;s section in the disk layout graph upwards until it&#8217;s large enough to store your operating system disc image. Apply the changes. It may take some time for the disk to be re-partitioned.</li>
    <li>Now, select the new partition from the list on the left. Go to the Restore tab, and restore your operating system disc image to the new partition.</li>
    <li>Once the restore is complete, restart your computer, holding Option (Alt) at start-up. This should bring up a list of available start-up disks. Choose your new partition.</li>
    <li>You should now be at the installer, and you can re-install to your primary partition. Once the installation is complete, delete your installation disc partition to and resize the primary partition to reclaim the extra space.</li>
</ol>


<p>That&#8217;s it! In retrospect, it&#8217;s completely obvious, but I haven&#8217;t seen these instructions anywhere else on the web. This technique might be particularly useful for owners of Macs without disc drives.</p>
