  <div class="entry-content"><p>This tutorial is for an extremely specific and possibly unusual set of circumstances, but I&#8217;m hoping that it will prove useful to someone. For one of my courses this term, we&#8217;re building OpenGL apps using Nokia&#8217;s open source Qt framework. Qt provides some very nice scaffolding, and the Qt Creator IDE is among the best I&#8217;ve used, although I imagine it lacks flexibility for general-purpose applications—that is, you probably wouldn&#8217;t use it to build non-Qt applications. Qt also allows one to easily write cross-platform C++ GUI applications. That said, linking procedures can be a bit different on different platforms, and as a beginner it&#8217;s not always immediately obvious how instructions for Windows development translate into other environments.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>In particular, I found myself having difficulty linking the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) with my project on Mac OS X. After much Googling and some frustration, I came up with the correct way to go about it, which is as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li>In Qt Creator, open your project file (.pro) in the text editor.  Right click on the text editor pane and select &#8220;Add Library&#8230;&#8221;</li>
    <li>Chose &#8220;System Library.&#8221;</li>
    <li>Locate the GLUT framework.  On my Mac, running Lion, I used <code>/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/GLUT.framework</code>. However, it seems there are multiple different copies on the disk that you could use.  If that path doesn&#8217;t work for you, just search for <code>glut.h</code> in Finder and you&#8217;ll find a copy of the framework.  The path you enter into Qt Creator should point to a <code>.framework</code> directory.</li>
    <li>Qt Creator will generate code in your project file which will link to the correct framework or library depending on which platform the code is being compiled on.</li>
    <li>Finally, because Apple loves to be different, the glut.h header path is different on OS X.  <strong>You&#8217;ll need to <code>#include &lt;GLUT/glut.h&gt;</code></strong>, instead of <code>&lt;gl/glut.h&gt;</code> is usually the case.  You can use preprocessor conditional statements to make this inclusion cross-platform:
<pre>#if defined(__APPLE__) || defined(MACOSX)
  #include &lt;GLUT/glut.h&gt;
#else
  #include &lt;gl/glut.h&gt;
#endif</pre>
</li>
</ol>


<p>That&#8217;s it! If you have any trouble, leave a comment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My internship recently ended, and as such, I had to move from Calgary back to Edmonton, where I&#8217;ll be completing the fourth year of my Computing Science degree at the University of Alberta. I hope to be able to write more about my internship later, but at the moment I want to share a handy trick I discovered for reinstalling OS X. The reason I bring up the move is that after I arrived in Edmonton, I found myself wanting to reformat my Mac Mini and re-install Snow Leopard, but my Snow Leopard disc was nowhere to be found. Luckily, as a semi-paranoid computer scientist with an abundance of disk space, I keep images of important discs on my network-attached storage device for just such occasions.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Unfortunately, however, the Snow Leopard disc image is large enough that it can only be burned to a dual-layer DVD. I don&#8217;t tend to keep writeable dual-layer DVDs lying around, so I needed a solution which required only the disc image itself. There are a number of methods available for installing OS X over the network, but none of them seemed to work for me—perhaps owing to the fact that I had only one Mac. Luckily, I discovered that you can install OS X from a separate partition on the same disk. Here&#8217;s how:</p>

<ol>
    <li>First, you&#8217;ll need to re-partition your disk. Open Disk Utility and select the disk you want to use. Be sure to select the disk itself, rather than one of its partitions, which are indented beneath the disk.</li>
    <li>Click the + button to add a new partition, and drag the new partition&#8217;s section in the disk layout graph upwards until it&#8217;s large enough to store your operating system disc image. Apply the changes. It may take some time for the disk to be re-partitioned.</li>
    <li>Now, select the new partition from the list on the left. Go to the Restore tab, and restore your operating system disc image to the new partition.</li>
    <li>Once the restore is complete, restart your computer, holding Option (Alt) at start-up. This should bring up a list of available start-up disks. Choose your new partition.</li>
    <li>You should now be at the installer, and you can re-install to your primary partition. Once the installation is complete, delete your installation disc partition to and resize the primary partition to reclaim the extra space.</li>
</ol>


<p>That&#8217;s it! In retrospect, it&#8217;s completely obvious, but I haven&#8217;t seen these instructions anywhere else on the web. This technique might be particularly useful for owners of Macs without disc drives.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t discuss politics on this site, but today warrants an exception. Canada has suffered a terrible loss with the death of Jack Layton, the leader of the federal New Democratic Party. He was an inspiring figure, hopeful and optimistic right to the end, and he devoted his life to the betterment of Canada and its citizens.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With the phenomenal and growing successes of the iPhone App Store, the Android Market, and the Xbox Live Indie Games marketplace, gamers have seen an unprecedented number of titles which could be described as &#8220;clones&#8221; of more successful games&mdash;or rip-offs, if you&#8217;re feeling less kind.  Along with these titles has come a veritable tsunami of hatred for their developers, from game critics and anonymous Internet commenters alike.  The commercial success of some of these titles, such as <em>Angry Birds</em>,<sup>1</sup> has shown that average gamers are happy to patronize any developer who can provide a fun experience, regardless of originality.  However, any mention of a new clone on a gaming blog or podcast inevitably brings about a stunning amount of vitriol from gamers who, presumably, are upset that their favorite megacorporations aren&#8217;t getting their due.<!--more--></p>




<p>I don&#8217;t understand this, but my best guess it that it stems from a misunderstanding of the motivations of game developers, and of the development process itself.  I hope that by illuminating those things I can do something to stem the tide of rage and indignation.  First, though, I&#8217;d like to briefly discuss the legality of game clones.  The patentability and copyrightability of game mechanics and &#8220;look and feel&#8221; varies from country to country.  Notably, the <a href="http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2010/e/ar52.html" target="_blank" title="European Patent Convention, Article 52">European Patent Convention explicitly states</a> that &#8220;schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, and programs for computers&#8221; are not patentable, whereas no such restriction exists in the United States.  There are <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2315/its_just_a_game_right_top_.php" target="_blank" title="Gamasutra: It's Just a Game, Right? Top Mythconceptions on Patent Protection of Video Games">several notable examples</a> of game-related patents in the United States, but the industry is young and there are relatively few legal precedents on their enforceability.  I am not a lawyer, so it would be unwise of me to assert too much here, but I will state that throwing around terms like &#8220;copyright infringement&#8221; is neither productive nor terribly meaningful when discussing game clones.</p>




<p>I&#8217;d also like to make clear that by &#8220;clone,&#8221; I mean a legitimately developed game with similar gameplay mechanics and/or art style to an established title.  I am emphatically <em>not</em> referring to situations in which actual code or art assets have been used without permission; under no circumstances do I condone actual copyright infringement.  Finally, in the interest of full disclosure, I should also inform you that I have a dog in this race, so to speak: my game, <em><a href="http://www.mlindgren.ca/projects/puzzle-panel">Puzzle Panel</a></em>, borrows gameplay mechanics from <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_Attack" target="_blank">Tetris Attack</a></em> and takes artistic cues from <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft" target="_blank">World of Warcraft</a></em>.</p>

<p><em>Tobar</em> for iOS is a recent example of the kinds of titles I&#8217;m talking about.  The game is a fairly obvious mimicry of <em><a href="http://supermeatboy.com" target="_blank">Super Meat Boy</a></em>, and while <em>Meat Boy</em> co-creator Edmund McMillian is relatively unperturbed by it, many of his fans are less forgiving.  I&#8217;m going to pick on the <a href="http://destructoid.com">Destructoid</a> community here for no other reason than that Destructoid is one of my favorite gaming publications, but a quick Google search reveals no shortage of hatred for <em>Tobar</em>.<sup>2</sup>  <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/meat-boy-dev-has-mixed-feelings-about-ios-knock-offs-205886.phtml#comment" target="_blank" title="Meat Boy dev has mixed feelings about iOS knock-offs - Destructoid">Destructoid user Noir Trilby writes</a>:</p>




<p><blockquote>What a shameless rip off. It&#8217;s good that Ed is cool about it and all, but if I was him I&#8217;d be raging. Both Apple and Android need someone doing some quality control on their aming services to screen out blatant rip offs like this.</blockquote></p>




<p>Even associate editor Jonathan Holmes goes so far as to say that the game &#8220;makes him frown,&#8221; which&mdash;though it doesn&#8217;t sound it&mdash;is fairly significant criticism coming from a man so kind and gentle as to have probably never said a genuinely hurtful thing is his life.</p>




<p>As I&#8217;ve already mentioned, I don&#8217;t think <em>Tobar</em>, nor other games like it, deserve the hate they receive.  There are a number of reasons why I feel this way.  First, all art is iterative, and video games are no exception.  Creativity is not binary, but is a matter of degree.  Second, when indie developers borrow from established properties, there&#8217;s little evidence that it&#8217;s detrimental to the owners of those properties, whereas it may be extremely beneficial to consumers.  Finally, I feel that there&#8217;s a misconception that games like <em>Tobar</em> exist because lazy, greedy developers want to make a quick buck and can&#8217;t be bothered to do the work to come up with an original title.  That perception is wrong on many levels, which I&#8217;ll discuss in further detail in the following paragraphs.</p>




<p>The apparent trend of smaller developers &#8220;ripping off&#8221; well known games is probably an illusion.  It&#8217;s likely that these are simply the instances of liberal borrowing that we hear about, due to the popularity of the &#8220;borrowee.&#8221;  Take <em>Angry Birds</em>, for example.  Most people would point to it as an example of a successful, original title by a studio that was relatively small at the time of its release.  The truth is that although its art style is unique, its gameplay mechanics are borrowed heavily from an older flash game called <em><a href="http://armorgames.com/play/3614/crush-the-castle" target="_blank">Crush the Castle</a></em>.  Or how about <em>Super Meat Boy</em>?  It surely owes some of its success to predecessors such as <em><a href="http://www.gamemakergames.com/archive/jumper-two" target="_blank">Jumper Two</a></em>, <em><a href="http://kayin.pyoko.org/iwbtg/" target="_blank">I Wanna Be The Guy</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.thewayoftheninja.org/" target="_blank">N+</a></em>.</p>

<p>Granted, each of these games have their own original elements, whereas <em>Tobar</em> at least appears to be a fairly direct attempt at reproducing <em>Super Meat Boy</em>.  But every great game stands on the shoulders of giants, and every developer has to start somewhere.  Games like <em>Tobar</em> should not be condemned as soulless exercises in profiteering, but recognized for what they are: a means for inexperienced developers to hone their skills while contributing to new markets, much as a musician might start out by covering popular songs in venues where the original artist would never perform.</p>




<p>Words like <em>stealing</em> and <em>theft</em> are often thrown around in discussions of game clones.  But one of the defining characteristics of theft is that it deprives the owner of his or her property.  What harm is the existence of <em>Tobar</em> doing to Team Meat?  Given that Team Meat&#8217;s Tommy Refenes has publicly stated that he has &#8220;no intentions on doing anything for iPhone or iPad ever&#8230;I hate the [iPhone and iPad] platforms and I hate the [app] stores,&#8221; <em>Tobar</em> is in no sense a competitor to <em>Super Meat Boy</em>.  I don&#8217;t know the developer of <em>Tobar</em>, but I&#8217;d wager that his intent was simply to bring gameplay he loves to a new platform that he&#8217;s passionate about.</p>




<p>Passion is exactly why I created <em>Puzzle Panel</em>; I wasn&#8217;t looking to make quick money by ripping off someone else&#8217;s creativity and putting it on a new platform.  Rather, I wanted to share a game that I loved with an audience who might have never seen it before, on a platform where it was unlikely to ever see the light of day otherwise.  I am not a veteran game critic who values unique mechanics above all else because he&#8217;s seen most gameplay elements a thousand times before, nor am I a would-be <em>artiste</em> desperately attempting to create a legacy for himself.  For these reasons, I value fun over originality.  If people enjoy my game, that is enough for me.  If a nervous child at the doctor&#8217;s office finds solace in something I&#8217;ve created, my work has paid off immeasurably.  If I can contribute just a little more happiness to someone&#8217;s life, I am satisfied.</p>




<p>&#8220;If the motivations of indie developers are purely in the interest of gamers,&#8221; you might ask, &#8220;why charge money for these clones?&#8221;  Well, the reasons are simple.  First, we&#8217;re human, and we need to eat; it&#8217;s nice to get paid for one&#8217;s work, even when said work is not completely novel.  Second, even discounting the dozens or hundreds of hours of effort required to make the simplest of games, there are significant up-front costs to developers in creating games.  Developer licenses, development software, test hardware, and licensed or commissioned music, sound effects and graphics add up very quickly.</p>




<p>I did all of the programming and artwork myself for <em>Puzzle Panel</em>, as well as much of the sound, and it still cost me over $1,000 to make.  To a student, that is a great deal of money.  I charged a dollar for the game, but in the end I recouped <em>none</em> of the cost of creating it.  I don&#8217;t regret a thing, but this illustrates the point that game development is anything but a quick and surefire way to get rich.  For every developer making money on their games, there are literally tens of thousands who sink in countless hours and significant money, only to receive nothing in return.  That being the case, I don&#8217;t give much credence to the argument that developers such as <em>Tobar</em>&#8217;s are just in it for the money.</p>

</div>




<p>Thus far I&#8217;ve been writing specifically about indie developers.  I&#8217;d be remiss to not mention that established, big-budget studios often clone each other&#8217;s games, or worse, the games of indie developers.  I&#8217;m much less sympathetic to this; like Jonathan Holmes with <em>Tobar</em>, I certainly frowned when I read about <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/capcom-copies-splosion-man-with-maxplosion-191411.phtml">Capcom&#8217;s obvious copy of indie hit <em>&#8216;Splosion Man</em></a>.  But although I personally find this distasteful, I still don&#8217;t see a great need for alarm.  A well-made, original title which has found an audience has little to fear from pretenders.</p>




<p>Now, please don&#8217;t misunderstand me.  I am by no means saying that every developer should just go out and rip off the biggest franchise he can because there&#8217;s nothing wrong with unoriginality.  On the contrary, innovation and creativity should be encouraged and rewarded, and while I think it&#8217;s fine for hobbyist programmers to start out by mimicking their favorite titles, we should definitely turn a more critical eye to established studios who have the time, budget and experience to be original but are content with releasing an endless stream of sequels, clones and remakes.  But please, let&#8217;s cut the indie developers some slack.  Cloning a popular game to make a quick buck is simply not a winning proposition.  Regardless of their originality, regardless of their financial success or failure, I can assure you that indies do it for the love.</p>


<p><sup>1</sup> <small>Although it has its own unique art style, I count <em>Angry
Birds</em> among the clones for its striking similarities to Armor Games&#8217;
<em>Crush the Castle</em>.</small><br/>
<sup>2</sup> <small>Ironically, the &#8220;negative&#8221; publicity <em>Tobar</em> is generating will probably help its sales more than anything else could have.</small></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a discussion today about what lambda functions are used for, how they differ from regular functions, and why they&#8217;re important. I thought I&#8217;d reproduce it here, as it seems that lambdas are often thought of as confusing and obscure. The truth is that they&#8217;re very simple, and also quite powerful. While they can reduce readability if used incorrectly, they do serve an important purpose, and those who understand them should have nothing to fear from them. This discussion pertains specifically to lambda functions as they&#8217;re implemented in Python, but they&#8217;re very similar in other languages where they&#8217;re available.<!--more--></p>

<p>I think the best way to explain lambdas is with a simple example. Say you want a switch statement. Python doesn’t have them, but what you can do is set up a dictionary and get a value out of it, which is sort of like a switch. However, you can&#8217;t do this&#8230;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">my_dict</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">my_func1</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">my_func2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>          <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>&#8230;because the functions will be evaluated when the dictionary is initialized, so if they modify any state (or if they just take a while to execute) you’ll get bad behaviour. Functions are first class objects in Python, so you could insert the functions into the dictionary like so…</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">my_dict</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">my_func1</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">my_func2</span>
</span><span class='line'>          <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>&#8230;but that doesn&#8217;t work either, because you don’t know how many (or which) arguments you need to pass to the function when you pull it out of the dictionary. So, what to do?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">my_dict</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">my_func1</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">my_func2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>          <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Lambdas solve the problem because they&#8217;re evaluated lazily. By being wrapped in
a lambda, the functions won’t be evaluated until the lambda itself is called.
Furthermore, you can use the lambda to normalize the parameters of each
function, so that you can always call it using <code>my_dict[my_var](x, y, z)</code>, even though the first function being called doesn’t actually make use of the z parameter. There is no other way to accomplish this in Python, besides a big long ugly list of ifs. (Obviously you’d normally reserve this technique for situations where you have more than two options.)</p>

<p>You can also use the laziness aspect of lambdas to refer to variables which haven&#8217;t been declared yet, although I&#8217;d recommend against that because it can become quite confusing. Anything within the lambda is evaluated only when the lambda is called.</p>

<p>And there you have it! Those are the basics of lambdas in Python. Of course, the above is only a trivial example of what can be accomplished with lambdas.  If you&#8217;d like to learn more, there&#8217;s a great write-up available <a title="Lambda functions in Python" href="http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/lambda_functions.hawk">here.</a></p>
