I don't discuss politics on this site, but today warrants an exception. Canada has suffered a terrible loss with the death of Jack Layton, the leader of the federal New Democratic Party. He was an inspiring figure, hopeful and optimistic right to the end, and he devoted his life to the betterment of Canada and its citizens. He was taken from us far too soon, and will be sorely missed.

Rest in peace.
