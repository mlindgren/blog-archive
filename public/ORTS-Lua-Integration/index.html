  <h2>Goal</h2>


<p>As described in the project proposal, the goal of this project was to modify the Open Real-Time Strategy game engine to allow for user interface customization through the use of the <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> scripting language.</p>

<h2>Prior Work</h2>


<h3>World of Warcraft</h3>


<p>The project itself was inspired by the user interface customization options available in World of Warcraft, hereafter referred to as WoW.  Numerous game engines, including many predating WoW, provide scripting support in various ways.  In most cases, though, these game engines used scripting only as a way to make development or game modification easier.  By contrast, WoW provides <em>user-centric</em> scripting, encouraging users to customize their own game experience through Lua scripts.  If it was not the first game to offer this mechanic, then it was certainly the first to bring it to prominence.</p>

<p><strong>Image 1 here</strong>
<em>Figure 1: A “stock” World of Warcraft user interface.</em></p>

<p><strong>Image 2 here</strong>
<em>Figure 2: A heavily modified World of Warcraft user interface.</em></p>

<p>In the above figures, the contrast between the “stock” World of Warcraft user interface is readily apparent.  In addition to the obvious visual differences, experienced WoW players will notice that the player in the lower screenshot is using mods which provide him or her with extra information not easily attainable from the stock UI.  For instance, the Grid UI script (lower right) shows important status information about other members of the player’s raid group which the stock UI cannot show in a convenient manner.  Although Blizzard Entertainment, the developer of WoW, has balanced scripting capabilities to ensure that they do not provide an unfair gameplay advantage, many of the game’s most competitive players find it hard to live without the extra information and input options they provide.</p>

<p>The success of user interface scripting in WoW is such that it is fast becoming a standard feature among massively multiplayer online games (MMOs).  Developer Trion Worlds initially released the critically acclaimed MMO Rift without scripting support, but with a much more customizable stock interface than WoW has to this day.  Nevertheless, after a huge demand from players, Trion added user interface scripting (with Lua) in a recent patch.</p>

<h3><strong>ORTS</strong></h3>


<p>Unbeknownst to me at the outset of the project, ORTS itself provides a robust scripting system for both gameplay and user interface scripting.  The system uses a completely custom language, which I believe to have been designed and implemented by  Tim Furtak.  While it is impressive that Tim designed and implemented a custom scripting environment, I feel that there are some significant shortcomings to his approach when considered from the perspective of a general game development project:</p>

<ul>
<ul>
    <li>Whereas there exists a large community of experienced Lua developers, including many who have prior experience with user interface scripting for video games, there are obviously no developers familiar with any custom “in-house” scripting system.  This limits the accessibility of the scripting features.</li>
    <li>In addition to the above, a custom language means that the development team themselves will be unable to leverage existing skillsets.</li>
    <li>Developing and implementing a custom scripting system is a significant undertaking and potentially a source of many difficult-to-fix bugs.</li>
    <li>A custom scripting engine which is even moderately generalized is unlikely to be as efficient as a standalone scripting system.</li>
</ul>
</ul>


<p>For the above reasons, I believe that there is a trend in the industry to move towards established languages for in-game scripting support.  Thus, although my project is something of a retread, it is not without merit, as it provides an opportunity to examine what I feel is a more modern approach to in-game scripting.</p>

<h2><strong>Process</strong></h2>


<p>At a broad level, I undertook the following four steps in implementing this project:</p>

<ol>
<ol>
    <li>Integrate the Lua runtime environment into the ORTS codebase.</li>
    <li>Expose new and existing ORTS functions to the Lua runtime, allowing it to query and in limited ways modify game state.</li>
    <li>Create Lua hooks for relevant game events such as frame redraw, allowing the Lua runtime to respond to such events.</li>
    <li>Design and implement a framework for the user interface in Lua, as well as sample UIs.</li>
</ol>
</ol>


<h3><strong>Step One: Lua Integration</strong></h3>


<p>The first step was also the easiest, as Lua was designed to be easily embeddable.  Integrating it with ORTS was a simple manner of downloading the Lua source code, putting it in a convenient directory, and integrating it with the ORTS makefiles.  From there, any ORTS code needing access to Lua needed only to call a few simple C functions to set up a Lua state and start executing code.</p>

<p>The most difficult part of this step was, surprisingly, finding a way to get Lua to build with ORTS.  (It was not excessively difficult, just more difficult than the other parts.)  I wanted the ORTS makefile to build Lua rather than requiring the user to manually install it on his or her system.   However, ORTS Makefile expects a certain structure in the files that it builds, and this makes it poorly suited for integration with third-party libraries which have their own specific build requirements.  In the end, I simply added a rule to the ORTS makefile which explicitly called make on the Lua makefile.  This is a less-than-ideal solution since it circumvents the typical ORTS library build process in a sense, but there was no easier way to go about it without significant overall changes.</p>

<h3><strong>Step Two: Exposing ORTS Functions to Lua</strong></h3>


<p>This step was perhaps the most challenging as it required me to build an in-depth understanding of the system for calling C functions from within Lua.  The Lua runtime uses a register-based virtual machine which operates in a manner that should be familiar to anyone with assembly language programming experience.  Although the virtual machine is register-based, when interacting with Lua from C one is only concerned with the stack.  The typical process for calling a C function from Lua is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<ol>
    <li>Create a Lua wrapper for the function you wish to call.  The wrapper must have a particular signature in order to be registrable with the Lua runtime.</li>
    <li>Within the wrapper, check the size of the Lua virtual machine (VM) stack to determine how many arguments were given.  (If an unexpected number of arguments were present, the developer will have to determine how to handle the error.)</li>
    <li>Using functions provided by the Lua API, retrieve argument values from the Lua stack.  The developer should check the arguments to ensure that they are valid for the C function to be called.</li>
    <li>Call the C function with the retrieved arguments.</li>
    <li>Report any errors and return the result to the Lua runtime by placing it on the stack.</li>
</ol>
</ol>


<p>The process is not complicated, but there are a number of important caveats.  First of all, the astute reader will notice that I’ve been referring to “C” rather than “C++.”  Lua is written in C, and provides only a C API.  This results in some challenges when interfacing with it using C++:</p>

<ul>
<ul>
    <li>Functions exposed to Lua cannot be member functions.  If you need to call a member function, you have to wrap it in a non-member function, and that function must have access to the object to call the member function on in one way or another.</li>
    <li>Lua provides types for passing, retrieving and even interacting with C structures in the Lua VM, using pointers.  However, as soon as you pass a pointer to Lua, type safety is lost.</li>
    <li>Additionally, memory management is a concern with pointers passed to Lua.  Although the Lua VM cannot deallocate your C/C++ objects, you must take care to ensure they are not deallocated while the Lua VM might be using them.</li>
    <li>Like many other scripting languages, Lua’s introspection features make it hard to “hide” data from the user.  This means the user could modify any pointer passed to the Lua VM, which could result in crashes or exploits.</li>
    <li>It is easy to write unsafe C/C++ code which can be called from the Lua VM and cause the host application to crash.</li>
    <li>Additionally, if one is not careful to properly use protected calls when calling from C/C++ to Lua, errors in the Lua code can crash the host application.</li>
</ul>
</ul>


<p>Due to the limited time available for this project, I was not able to come up with a robust solution to the pointer modification problem; thus, in my ORTS code, there are certain pointers exposed in the Lua VM which an astute user could theoretically modify to exploit the game.  (That said, the somewhat atypical client-server architecture of ORTS probably severely limits any advantages the user could hope to give himself.  A more likely scenario is that an unwitting user could accidentally modify the pointers and cause the application to crash.)</p>

<p>In the interest of rapid development, my goal was to provide as few ORTS functions to the Lua VM as possible, and to write all of the user interface code in Lua.  I was largely successful in this endeavor, and in a few cases I managed to take advantage of some of Tim Furtak’s existing UI scripting functions.</p>

<p>One of the most challenging aspects of exposing ORTS functionality and game information to Lua came in the form of making my scripting system interact with Tim’s existing system.  In ORTS, game rules and unit attributes are defined in scripts.  Thus, for my Lua scripts to be able to access game state, I had to figure out how to call the relevant functions which were designed for <em>Tim’s </em>scripting system.</p>

<p>For some aspects of development this proved to be a minor inconvenience, whereas for others it became a major stumbling block.  For instance, Tim’s scripting system is by necessity tightly integrated with the “action” system for in game units.  Each unit defines its actions and the buttons corresponding to those actions entirely in scripts.  The complex manner in which these actions are defined and organized meant that I had to fall back on the existing UI for actions and action buttons.</p>

<p>Needless to say, integrating the two scripting systems was a complicated process and resulted in some less-than-optimal code.  If one were to pursue the idea of using Lua scripting in ORTS, ideally Tim’s system would be replaced and all gameplay information would be defined in Lua scripts.  Naturally, that would make it much easier for the user interface to interact with game state.  That said, replacing Tim’s scripting system entirely with Lua would probably be tantamount to a complete rewrite.  Perhaps it’s something to consider for ORTS 2.</p>

<h3><strong>Step Three: Notify Lua of Game Events</strong></h3>


<p>This step was relatively simple.  Calling Lua code from C/C++ is a simple matter of using the Lua API to find the “index” of the relevant Lua function, pushing the arguments onto the stack, and then executing the function.  Thus, I was able to notify Lua (by calling user-defined Lua functions) of the following events:</p>

<ul>
<ul>
    <li>During frame redraw, Lua is notified after the 3D world is drawn.  This allows Lua to draw the user interface on top of 3D world.</li>
    <li>Lua is notified when the mouse is moved or a mouse button is pressed.</li>
    <li>Lua is notified when a key is pressed.</li>
</ul>
</ul>


<h3><strong>Step Four: Lua UI Framework</strong></h3>


<p>For this step, I leveraged my experience in designing and implementing UI components for my iPhone game, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obg-I9JnzFU">Puzzle Panel</a>.  For simplicity, the UI framework uses a simple delegate model so that individual “widgets” can respond to events.</p>

<p>The user creates a layout by adding widgets to the framework using a provided function.  There is no pre-defined structure for a widget; it can be any Lua class, so long as it provides all of the methods necessary to respond to actions for which it has been marked a delegate.  Naturally, all widgets are drawable, so each time the framework is notified by ORTS of a frame redraw, the draw method of each widget is called.  Widgets are drawn in the order they were added to the scene.</p>

<p>In addition to drawing, widgets can be registered as key listeners or mouse listeners.  Key listeners are notified of key presses by the framework; mouse listeners are notified of mouse presses and movement.  The notification occurs in order of priorities specified by the user, and any listener can choose to “consume” relevant events by returning true in its notification function.  (Mouse movement cannot be consumed for obvious reasons.)  Consumed events are not propagated to lower-priority listeners, and additionally, are not passed on to the native ORTS code.  Thus, Lua scripts can override default ORTS behavior.</p>

<p>Using the simple primitives I set up in steps two and three, I was able to build a fairly complex user interface system which could, with enough additional Lua code, provide most of the functionality expected of modern windowing systems.  Although the time I had available for this project limited the number of widgets I was able to implement, many more widgets are theoretically possible.</p>

<h2><strong>Challenges Encountered</strong></h2>


<p>In addition to the challenges already discussed in the Process section, there were a number of general challenges which I had to overcome in undertaking this project.  First and foremost was simply learning to work with ORTS itself.  Although it is an impressive research project, ORTS has not seen serious development in a number of years, and it has a number of serious issues which impede further development efforts.</p>

<ul>
<ul>
    <li>A large number of dependencies must be manually installed to compile and run ORTS (if one is working in an environment where those dependencies have not already been installed, i.e. other than the University of Alberta lab machines.)</li>
    <li>Although it claims to be platform-independent, getting ORTS to build on modern Mac OS X is very difficult.  Even after successfully compiling it, I was never able to get it to run properly; the ortsg window never appears, and both orts and ortsg crash on exit.I spent a great deal of time trying to find workarounds for these problems, but to no avail.  I think it is likely that were they overcome, other problems would occur on Mac OS X as well.  In addition, I have heard from other students that ortsg freezes after a matter of seconds when built and executed on Windows.</li>
    <li>The <em>unmodified </em>ortsg application suffers from seemingly random (and therefore not easily reproducible, and hence not easily debuggable) segmentation faults on the lab machines.  Segmentation faults occasionally occur on startup, but more often .  This remains a source of concern for me; it is difficult to guarantee that my own code does not cause segmentation faults when the existing code does at random.</li>
    <li>Many or perhaps all of the example games and applications included with the ORTS source code do not seem to build and run properly—at least, not without invoking some black magic compilation procedure which is not made clear by the sparse documentation, as far as I can tell.</li>
</ul>
</ul>


<p>Compilation and segmentation fault issues not withstanding, the ORTS code itself is not very easy to work with in some respects.  The code suffers from a serious lack of comments in many places, which meant that figuring out which functions to call and where was largely a process of trial and error for me.</p>

<p>The extent to which the code is modularized and the particular manner in which it is organized makes it difficult to quickly gain an understanding of.  This problem is exacerbated by the occasional use of complicated preprocessor macros.  To some extent I think these problems are endemic to large C++ projects in general, and with time the structure of the ORTS system as a whole would have likely become more familiar and made more sense to me.</p>

<p>In the process section, I discussed in detail the challenges I encountered in integrating Lua with the ORTS C++ code.  Most of these challenges arose due to the fact that the Lua API is a C API.  There are frameworks designed to ease the process of integrating Lua with C++; one such framework is <a href="http://www.rasterbar.com/products/luabind.html">Luabind</a>.  It likely would have been beneficial in this project.  Unfortunately, Luabind requires the <a href="http://www.boost.org/boost-build2/doc/html/bbv2/jam.html">Boost.Jam</a> build system.  After some investigation, I decided that setting up Boost.Jam and, in particular, integrating it with the existing ORTS build process would take up too much time that I could otherwise spend on functionality, and decided to hand-write all of my Lua integration code.  Of course, one advantage to not using Luabind is that I gained a greater understanding of the standard Lua API than I would have had I used it.</p>

<h2><strong>Results</strong></h2>


<p>The following series of screenshots serve as an example of the basic functionality that can be accomplished with my Lua UI modification system:</p>

<p><strong>Images here</strong></p>

<p><em>Figure 3: The standard ortsg user interface.</em></p>

<p><em>Figure 4: An ortsg interface modified with Lua, mimicking StarCraft 2.</em></p>

<p><em>Figure 5: A minimalist ortsg interface.</em></p>

<p><strong>End images</strong></p>

<p>While the changes may appear primarily cosmetic, a significant amount of work is taking place on the backend to relay information from the standard ORTS scripting environment to the Lua scripting environment.  For instance, in order to simply draw the player’s resource counts, the Lua script must be able to query the game state, find the scripted player object, access its resource count attributes by name, and retrieve the values.  All of this is non-trivial.</p>

<h2><strong>Possible Improvements</strong></h2>


<ul>
<ul>
    <li>Scripted actions from the existing system could be exposed to Lua, which would allow for the interface to be design entirely in Lua.  As mentioned in the process section, currently the Lua interface falls back on Tim’s scripted interface for actions and action buttons due to complications in interfacing the two.  This would be a significant undertaking.</li>
    <li>A more robust way to provide access to C++ objects from Lua would be beneficial from a security and stability perspective.  As previously mentioned, currently raw C++ pointers are exposed to Lua, which negates type safety and allows scriptwriters to perform unsafe operations.I suspect that the proper way to handle this is to give Lua access only to some sort of non-pointer identifier for objects it needs to know about.  For instance, for C++ objects stored in a std::map&lt;string, ?&gt;, Lua could access the objects by their identifying strings.  Unfortunately this requires an overall system architecture designed with special Lua identifiers in mind, which made it unfeasible for this project.</li>
    <li>Currently modifications such as adding and removing widgets from the UI must be performed in Lua code, or in the Lua console widget (by executing Lua code.)  It would be much more user-friendly to provide and in-game interface for adding, enabling and disabling UI scripts.</li>
</ul>
</ul>


<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>


<p>In the project proposal, I set out three metrics on which to determine the success or failure of the project.  The metrics were as follows:</p>

<h3><strong>First Metric</strong></h3>


<p><strong>“ORTS users are able to customize their user interfaces through the use of Lua scripts.”</strong></p>

<p>Obviously the project has been successful in this regard.  I have successfully integrated Lua and provided the means to build a completely custom UI.  As previously mentioned, Lua provides the advantage of being a widely-used scripting language, so whereas there would be a significant learning curve to creating UI scripts with Tim’s custom language, anyone with UI scripting experience in any of the triple-A games using Lua will be comfortable with my framework.</p>

<h3><strong>Second Metric</strong></h3>


<p><strong>“The customization options are non-trivial.”</strong></p>

<p><strong> </strong>In this regard I must confess that I did not accomplish as much as I had hoped to be able to, due to limited time and a heavy course load.  I had to focus on reproducing standard UI functionality in my framework, and although the resulting system offers potentially unlimited cosmetic options, the ability to interact with game state from within Lua scripts is limited.</p>

<p>Ideally, I would have liked to implement features allowing limited unit control via scripting.  Although micromanagement of units is an important measure of skill for top-tier RTS players, as a player of (extremely) limited skill I’ve always found it tedious to the point of interfering with my enjoyment of the games.  To that end, I was planning to give players the option to write simple “AI scripts” which could be executed on command to make units perform certain actions; this would have provided a means of responding to varied situations at the “micro” level without requiring a high rate of actions-per-minute (APM).  Unfortunately, I had to cut this feature due to time limitations.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, my framework does offer players the opportunity to display game information in whatever layout and format best suits their needs.  Another problem I have with many RTS games is that the UIs tend to be large and cumbersome, obscuring a significant portion of the screen.  Even without any of the functionality I described above as missing, my framework would certainly solve that properly when applied to a typical RTS.</p>

<h3><strong>Third Metric</strong></h3>


<p><strong>“Customization is simple enough that anyone with a programming background can pick it up easily.”</strong></p>

<p><strong> </strong>This is one area where I feel that my framework excels, particularly in comparison to the existing ORTS UI scripting system.  Lua has more than a few syntactic and design quirks, but for the most part it is similar enough to the most popular scripting languages (e.g. PHP, Python, Perl and Ruby) that anyone experienced in one of those languages should be able to grasp it very quickly.  Indeed, prior to embarking on this project I had no experience whatsoever with Lua.</p>

<p>By contrast, Tim’s scripting language has a more verbose C-style syntax which is mixes in unusual syntax such as variable declarations which are not delimited by semicolons as other statements are.  Semicolons seem to take the place of commas in some function calls but not others, and there appears to be a distinction between “classes” and “blueprints” which is anything but intuitive.  As I mentioned previously, I think that Tim’s custom scripting system is an impressive technical achievement, and I do not wish to disparage the work he put into it.  After some time working with it, I imagine scripting in his language would become fairly natural.  I merely highlight these peculiarities to reinforce my earlier assertion that an established scripting language is preferable to a custom language.  Documentation alone makes it much easier for a new user to get up to speed with Lua than with Tim’s language, as documentation for the latter is extremely limited.</p>

<p>Besides the contrast between the languages themselves, I designed the framework in such a manner as to make interactions and patterns simple and obvious.  The delegate model is used in a number of real-world user interface libraries including Apple’s cocoa library, and although mine is obviously less polished, the presence of familiar conventions should make it easy for inexperienced users to add new widgets.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall Conclusion</strong></h3>


<p>On the whole I am satisfied with the outcome of the project.  I have gained valuable experience in designing user-oriented scripting systems, and I am now aware of some of the challenges involved in providing client-side scripting in games.  I now feel confident that I will be able to successfully integrate Lua scripting into my personal projects in the future, which will no doubt be beneficial in a number of scenarios.</p>
