Via [a comment on Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/01/untitled/#comment-170665),
[Measure of Doubt](http://measureofdoubt.com/) discusses some strategies for
effective written communication, using a "consequentialist" approach. This is
probably the one I need to work on most:

Good advice, although I think it does depend to an extent on the audience you're
writing for&mdash;which is something you must always be mindful of. Personally,
I quite enjoy the occasional 10,000 word epic.
