  <div class="entry-content"><p>Or &ldquo;buying used cars is the worst and I will never do it ever again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I recently purchased a new-to-me 2011
<a href="http://www.subaru.com/vehicles/impreza-wrx/index.html">Subaru WRX STI</a> sedan.
I had been thinking about buying a new car for a long time&mdash;since I
graduated, more or less. Until I bought my Subaru, I owned an ageing Honda Civic
(1997, to be precise).  While it was a very capable and extremely reliable car
throughout the many years I owned it for, it was old enough that it lacked some
of the conveniences one expects in a car these days, such as power locks and
windows, and most importantly, air conditioning.  The lack of air conditioning
in particular made it  less than ideal for summer road trips, and more
importantly, it was in need of some moderately expensive maintenance, and it
didn&rsquo;t seem to make sense to me to spend much money on it given that the overall
value of the car was fairly low.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t go on many test drives before I purchased my Subaru, but I didn&rsquo;t feel
the need to; I had already spent months watching reviews, reading forums,
comparing specs and window shopping on AutoTrader. I knew I wanted a sporty car
with plenty of horsepower for under $40,000, and all-wheel drive was a must as I
go to the mountains nearly every weekend in the winter and almost as often in
the summer. Besides the STI, the Evo, MazdaSpeed3, and the Golf R were the best
contenders, but each had significant drawbacks with regard to my personal
preferences. The Evo has a notoriously lacklustre interior (not that the STI is
<em>a lot</em> better, to be fair); I don&rsquo;t like the way the MazdaSpeed3 looks, and the
Golf comes with the reputation of higher maintenance costs for German cars.</p>

<p>I also really like the Subaru community.
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/subaru">/r/subaru</a> is the largest manufacturer-specific
subreddit, and in addition to forums like <a href="http://forums.nasioc.com/">NASIOC</a>,
it comprises a vibrant community of enthusiastic Subaru owners. Of course other
brands have significant followings as well&mdash;particularly VW&mdash;but my
impression of the Subaru community is that it&rsquo;s less elitist and, in contrast to
the others, puts as much emphasis on what one can <em>do</em> with the cars as on the
cars themselves. To &ldquo;go Subaruing&rdquo; is a popular term for going out into the mud
or the snow or the sand or the bush and getting the car wet and dirty, and
having a ton of fun in the process.</p>

<p>The STI, then, was the clear winner in my eyes.  Truth be told, a WRX probably
would have been more than sufficient for my needs, but I generally prefer to put
down the extra money and be sure that I&rsquo;m getting the best product. And hey, one
only has so long to exercise the opportunity to be young and irresponsible!</p>

<h2>Finding My Car</h2>

<p>So, finally I decided to bite the bullet, and I found a used STI that looked
really nice on Craigslist. On March 9th, 2013, I went with a friend to
<a href="http://www.rentonsubaru.com/index.htm">Walker&rsquo;s Renton Subaru</a>
to look at the vehicle and take it for a test drive.  Walker&rsquo;s is sort of two
separate dealerships on the same lot; there&rsquo;s the Subaru dealership and there&rsquo;s
also <a href="http://www.rentonmazda.com/index.htm">Walker&rsquo;s Renton Mazda</a>.  Obviously
they&rsquo;re both under the same ownership, and it seems that salespeople on one lot
can sell cars on the other lot as well; the car I went to look at was listed as
being at the Subaru dealership, but I ultimately ended up dealing primarily with
the Mazda dealership because that is where the salesman I first contacted
worked.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dealerrater.com/sales/Ken-Palmer-review-33450/">Ken Palmer</a> was the
salesperson I dealt with. Both he and the dealership itself have very high
ratings on the site that link points to (DealerRater.com), which is surprising
to me because dealing with them (particularly the dealership; I have less
animosity for Ken) has been by far the worst experience I&rsquo;ve ever had as a
consumer.  The reason for that will become clear shortly, but bear in mind that
even before I discovered the major issue which prompted this post, I would not
have said that my buying experience with Walker&rsquo;s was <em>good</em> by any means.
Incidentally, their
<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/walkers-renton-subaru-renton-2">Yelp ratings</a> are
considerably lower, although there aren&rsquo;t as many reviews on Yelp.</p>

<p>We went to the Mazda dealership and I took a look at the car. It looked great;
the paint job was (and is) in great shape for the most part, although there were
a number of small nicks on the rear doors where the body flares out into the
wide wheel arches, as well as some on the front bumper pieces where the fog
lights would go (this car doesn&rsquo;t have fog lights).  I didn&rsquo;t really notice
those at the time, but they&rsquo;re minor and I doubt they would have influenced my
purchasing decision anyway. There was also some minor cosmetic damage to the
interior: a bit of chipping on the painted bezel around the satellite navigation
unit and centre vents, a white mark on the driver&rsquo;s side between the centre
console and the steering wheel, another on the glove box, and a minor nick in
the steering wheel leather. There is some minor curb rash on wheels which I
somehow failed to notice before I bought the car, but it&rsquo;s not noticeable from a
distance of more than a few feet. Overall the car appeared to be in excellent
condition.</p>

<p>We went for a test drive and I really liked the way it handled. Traffic was
moderately heavy and I didn&rsquo;t get much of a chance to open up the taps and
really test our the car&rsquo;s power on the route we took.  Truth be told, I wasn&rsquo;t
even doing a particularly good job driving it, as I&rsquo;d driven a manual car a
grand total of two times before that test drive, including once on the way to
the dealership&mdash;I drove my friend&rsquo;s car there to get some additional
practice<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Even so, I could tell then that I would grow to love the car
more and more as I learned how to drive it better, and in retrospect I was
completely correct about that.</p>

<p>During the test drive I noticed that the exhaust was very loud&mdash;not
irritatingly so, and I loved the way it sounded, but I thought it couldn&rsquo;t
possibly be stock so I asked Ken. He confirmed that it was stock, which at the
time I naÃ¯vely accepted. I later found out that this was not true.  I believe
that the downpipe, midpipe and catalytic converter are stock, but the tail pipe
seems to have been replaced with a
<a href="http://shop.namelessperformance.com/sti-sedan-axleback/">Nameless Performance AxelBack Muffler Delete</a>.
That&rsquo;s strike number one against Ken. I like the exhaust, and I don&rsquo;t mind that
it&rsquo;s aftermarket, but he should have done his research on the vehicle before
trying to sell it to me. If he wasn&rsquo;t sure whether or not the exhaust was stock,
he could have answered honestly and we could have looked it up to find the
correct answer. It irritates me that I was given false information, and while
everyone makes mistakes, given what I now know I can&rsquo;t help but ascribe this to
him valuing presentation over honesty.</p>

<h2>This Is Where It Gets Unpleasant</h2>

<p>We got back to the dealership and I decided that I liked the car enough that I
was prepared to sit down and negotiate on the price.  The list price on the
Craigslist ad I&rsquo;d responded to was around $32,000, but I told Ken that I was not
prepared to pay that much and that I was looking for $29,000. He said there was
no way he could go that low, as the price they were offering was already low in
his opinion. For the record, the Blue Book value for the car as I bought it is
currently $32,900 when purchased through a dealership, but that assumes
excellent condition, which I don&rsquo;t think the car <em>quite</em> qualifies for given the
minor cosmetic damage to the interior and the fact that some of the tires are at
less than 75% tread depth. The private party Blue Book value given those facts
is currently $30,000. Ultimately I paid $31,000, which given dealership markup
seemed reasonable at the time.</p>

<p>I spent quite a long time negotiating with Ken, so I want to take some time to
describe his personality and style as a salesperson. I can&rsquo;t help but view him
as a reasonably nice guy. He seemed to be friendly and in possession of a good
sense of humour, and was very patient with my less than stellar manual driving.
That said, he was subtly pushing me to spend more than I wanted to, and he gave
me misinformation and made statements of dubious veracity in several instances
(I hesitate to say &ldquo;lied&rdquo;).  For instance, when I told him I didn&rsquo;t <em>need</em> a new
car and that I could just as easily walk away, he repeatedly emphasized that the
STI was &ldquo;a hot item&rdquo; and that if I left and came back tomorrow, it might not
still be on the lot.  This is kind of true under the right circumstances, but I
had been looking at Craigslist and AutoTrader for months at this point, and I
knew that this car in particular had been sitting on their lot for at least a
month&mdash;maybe more like two months.  That fact was also ascertainable from
some of the paperwork Ken gave me on the vehicle, so it was a pretty poor
attempt to mislead me.</p>

<p>I also happened to notice that the price on Craigslist had dropped something
like $50 between the night before and the day I was there, so I called him on
that as well. He changed his story at that point and told me how the STI is a
performance car for a particular type of buyer, and not just anyone would be
looking for one, to which I replied: yeah, that&rsquo;s my point!  It&rsquo;s a sought-after
car but it&rsquo;s also not something just anyone is going to drop in and buy, so I
know you can&rsquo;t sell it as quickly as you say you can.</p>

<p>While Ken repeatedly insisted that he was on my side and wanted to work with me
to get me the best deal possible, and that he wasn&rsquo;t a typical pushy sales guy,
I&rsquo;d also describe his tactics as emotionally manipulative.  During the
negotiation whenever I requested something and he went and talked to his manager
and came back with a not-quite-good-enough offer, he&rsquo;d walk back to the desk
languidly with his head hung in faux-exhaustion, and say with an exasperated
sigh that he just couldn&rsquo;t make it work or something along those lines.  The
friend I&rsquo;d come with told me at one point that he was using tricks specifically
tailored to work on my personality type, which I think is probably an accurate
assessment because even though I knew what he was doing, I think there was a
subconscious element of feeling bad for the guy and wanting to work with him for
that reason.</p>

<p>After the initial negotiation we ended up agreeing on $30,800, conditional on me
being able to take the car to an independent mechanic for an inspection. I am
about as mechanically adept as Jeremy Clarkson, but without the benefit of his
encyclopedic knowledge of cars.  For that reason, I hadn&rsquo;t even bothered to look
under the hood, and it was important to me to get the car checked out
independently to verify its condition.</p>

<p>The process got a little strange at this point. I wanted to write above that we
verbally agreed on $30,800, but that&rsquo;s not quite accurate.  Ken and I would
agree on something and he&rsquo;d write down the offer on paper and make a crude &ldquo;sign
here&rdquo; line and ask me to initial it.  Even though I knew his handwritten offer
couldn&rsquo;t possibly be legally binding, and he assured me of as much, I was a bit
hesitant to do this as it just gave me a bad vibe.  But he refused to proceed
unless I&rsquo;d initial his paper, so I did.  He took that to his manager and finally
we were able to come to an agreement.</p>

<p>I got a temporary permit to drive the car and took it to
<a href="http://www.communityautomotiveservice.net/">Community Automotive Service</a>
in Burien, which, strangely, seems to be one of very few mechanics in the area
south of Seattle. I paid around $80 for the mechanic there to do a quick
examination of the car. He pulled the ODBII codes, checked the brakes, fluid
levels, etc, and took the car for a short test drive, among other things.  When
I came back to pick it up he told me that overall it was in great condition, but
it seemed that the 30,000 mile maintenance had never been done.  That was pretty
alarming to me as the car was at approximately 33,500 miles at that point,
meaning it was 3,500 miles overdue for some fairly important maintenance. I
expected the dealership to have done that maintenance as part of the trade in process
and factored the cost into the price they paid for the car; as far as I&rsquo;m
concerned, one shouldn&rsquo;t even be taking the car on test drives when it&rsquo;s 3,500
miles overdue for maintenance.  I got antsy when my Civic was a couple hundred
kilometres overdue for an oil change, and an STI has considerably more power
with which to rip itself apart if it&rsquo;s not kept in good condition. In retrospect
I think that alone should have been enough to make me go look elsewhere, but I
had already spent probably 4-5 hours at this point between the test drive and
the negotiating. I didn&rsquo;t want all of that time to be for nothing.</p>

<p>To be specific, the mechanic at Community Automotive said that a number of the
car&rsquo;s fluids needed to be flushed, that the air and fuel filters needed to be
replaced, that the brake pads would need to be replaced within a few months, and
that it would need new tires in the not-too-distant future.  His statement about
the tires turned out to be questionable as I later found out that they do all
still have more than 50% tread depth remaining, but the rest of his findings
seem to have been accurate. He also gave me a printout of the ODBII history.
There were a few error codes (abnormal clutch signal, power supply voltage
failure, excessive variation from steering position sensor, and right-hand
curtain airbag control module failure), but they were from the past and not
reproducible so he said he didn&rsquo;t feel that they were anything to worry about.
Overall, he told me that he liked the car and thought it was in great shape
except for the maintenance that needed to be done.  He thought the price I&rsquo;d
agreed on was a bit high, but I don&rsquo;t think he was aware of how high the Blue
Book value for the vehicle was, because he seemed surprised when I told him that
as well.</p>

<p>I went back to the dealership and began hours more of painful negotiation.
Given the issues that the mechanic had identified I was not willing to pay
$30,800 unless the dealership would fix some of them.  They were very reluctant
to budge on this and in the end I gave in more than I probably should have.  I
talked to both Ken and his manager, and both were incredulous about the report
that the mechanic had given me; they didn&rsquo;t feel that most of the items were
real issues.  I very clearly recall Ken&rsquo;s manager,
<a href="http://www.dealerrater.com/sales/Jan-Rac-review-136803">Jan Rac</a>,
giving me a spiel about how Walker&rsquo;s Renton Subaru had well-qualified
technicians, how they had a reputation to uphold, and how they had the only &ldquo;STI
tech&rdquo; in the area and that nobody else is allowed to work on STIs.  I thought at
the time that much of this was probably a huge load of bullshit, and in
retrospect it <em>almost certainly</em> is.  As far as I can tell there is no such
thing as an &ldquo;STI tech.&rdquo; Nissan has something like that for GT-Rs, but that&rsquo;s a
$100,000 car.  I cannot find any reference, anywhere, to any such thing as an
&ldquo;STI tech.&rdquo;  I do not like being lied to.</p>

<p>Ken, who had previously been absolutely fine with me taking the car to an
independent mechanic and was convinced that I wouldn&rsquo;t find any issues,
exasperatedly told me how independent mechanics never say anything good about
cars; they&rsquo;re only looking for problems (yes, that&rsquo;s <em>exactly the point</em>) and
implied that the guy I&rsquo;d taken it to was just looking to cash in&hellip;  even after
my wife and I<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> repeatedly told him that we had no affiliation with that
mechanic and that the mechanic knew that we would not be taking the car back to
him for repairs. We negotiated more and finally agreed to them replacing the
brake pads and doing some of the fluid flushes in exchange for bumping the sale
price up to $31,000 (because the brake pad replacement alone cost almost $600
since the STI uses Brembo pads).  It terms of the maintenance they offered, it
wasn&rsquo;t that great a deal for me, and as I mentioned earlier, in retrospect I
really should have just walked at this point. In fact I almost did over a
miscommunication about the brake pad replacement: I wanted all of them replaced,
but Ken had assumed I meant only one pair and had neglected to ask <em>which</em> pair.
I had been at the dealership literally all day at this point; I was there for at
least ten hours, and I really wanted to close the deal just so it wouldn&rsquo;t be a
huge waste of time.  Nevertheless I told them it was all of the brake pads or I
was leaving, and after some pageantry about confirming the offer with the sales
manager (who had already left at this point), we finally reached an agreement.</p>

<p>I added on some extras as well, including 3M protection for the front of the
vehicle for around $600, and an extended warranty for around $2000. Including
taxes, the total cost was around $38,000.</p>

<h2>Foreshadowing</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where things get <em>really</em> shady.  I left the car at the dealership to
have the service done so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to drive back to Renton for it (which
is a 30 minute to one hour drive from where I live in Redmond, depending on
traffic).  When I came back to pick up the car, I went to the service desk to
get the keys and request a copy of the service history and schedule so that I
would have it for my records (and to verify that they actually did the work).
The service advisor I talked to, whose name I think is Kay, asked me if I was
aware that the car had been in an accident and had had about $4,000 worth of
bodywork done. My heart leapt into my throat at this revelation, and I said that
no, I did <em>not</em> know that, and in fact I had been told that the car had <em>not</em>
been in any accidents.  She got an &ldquo;oh shit&rdquo; kind of look on her face and then
said she&rsquo;d double check, and after a bit of typing told me that actually she&rsquo;d
just typed the VIN in wrong, and that this car was fine.</p>

<p>This is what those of a literary predilection might call foreshadowing.</p>

<p>I was too relieved to really think too much of it at the time, and anyway the
contract had already been signed at this point, but knowing what I do now this
is obviously <em>hugely</em> suspicious.  Kay strikes me as a nice person, and I mean
genuinely nice rather than in a salesperson sort of way where niceness is
necessitated as a means of being persuasive.  I really want to believe that she
actually did just type in the wrong VIN and wasn&rsquo;t lying to me.  But&hellip; well,
let&rsquo;s do some math.</p>

<p>A VIN is 17 alphanumeric characters long, and each character has certain
restrictions on what it can be.  That means that there are 6.5273512 &times;
10<sup>25</sup> possible VINs.  That is a very, very large number.  VINs have
been in use since 1954, and the number of cars in the world just surpassed one
billion in 2011, but I think the source I got that from was only referring to
cars currently on the road.  So I think it&rsquo;s generous to assume that there have
been 10 billion cars with VINs since 1954.  Now, I was never very good at
statistics so this calculation is probably inaccurate for a host of reasons, but
by my math that means that if you type an arbitrary wrong digit when entering a
VIN, you have a 1.532015 &times; 10<sup>-16</sup> chance of getting a vehicle
that actually <em>exists.</em>  By way of comparison, that is 8 orders of magnitude
more unlikely than getting six of six numbers on the 6/49<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know all the details of how VINs really work; they&rsquo;re definitely not
uniformly distributed, and as I said, I was never very good at statistics
anyway.  So let&rsquo;s make this a little simpler.  The last six digits of a VIN are
sequential, and to the best of my knowledge, if all the other digits are fixed
then then all of the possibilities afforded by those last six digits should
refer to the same model of car, for the same model year, made by the same plant.
In North America the last five digits must be numeric, but since STIs are
manufactured in Japan, I think that gives us 33<sup>6</sup> possibilities
(because some characters are excluded), which is 1,291,467,969.  So again, the
possibility of typing a wrong digit in an arbitrary position and getting a car
that actually exists is very low.  But even assuming that she managed to do
that, I&rsquo;m fairly certain their service records only show cars that have actually
come to <em>that dealership</em> for service.</p>

<p><em>So how the fuck could she have possibly happened upon the same car, that came
to their dealership and got work done for an accident which probably would have
cost a similar amount to fix to the one my car was in, by typing in the wrong
VIN?</em> If anyone has a plausible explanation for this please do let me know, but
I just cannot believe that that really happened unless I have <em>incredible</em> bad
luck.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, I didn&rsquo;t think too much of what Kay said at the time. I got the car; the brakes had been
replaced; things seemed fine.  Ken told me that the difference with the new
brakes was really noticeable and that he was glad they got that done for me.
I couldn&rsquo;t help but think &ldquo;Oh, you mean the same brake pads you and your manager
were telling me <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> need to be replaced when I bought the car from you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 3M service hadn&rsquo;t been done yet as it had to be scheduled in advance.  I
ended up waiting until the 8th of April to get that done.  When I dropped the
car off for that, I asked Kay to check if they had actually done the fluid
flushes they were supposed to, as the service record I&rsquo;d received from the last
time I picked the car up only indicated the brake replacement.  I hadn&rsquo;t noticed
that at the time because my mind was on the supposed accident damage that she
told me about.  She checked and sure enough they had <em>not</em> done the fluid
flushes, which they were contractually obligated to do.  She said that they&rsquo;d
get it done with the 3M service, and indeed they did (or at least they gave me a
service record indicating such&mdash;I don&rsquo;t really have the expertise to check
myself).  I wondered if they neglected to do this the first time on purpose,
hoping that I just wouldn&rsquo;t notice.  When I picked up the car the next time, Kay
told me she was really glad that they had done the rear differential fluid
flush, as the fluid had been <em>very</em> overdue for a change.  I think the word she
used to describe it was &ldquo;pudding&rdquo; or &ldquo;sludge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Recall that this is the maintenance they told me their world-class technicians
hadn&rsquo;t felt it necessary to do. I&rsquo;m sure you can understand that my attitude at this
point was <strong>fuck these guys.</strong></p>

<h2>The Short-lived Honeymoon</h2>

<p>Finally, I had the car and all the service was done, and I was overjoyed. It was
a ton of fun to drive, and I quickly (in my opinion, anyway) became more adept
at driving a manual. I bought floor mats and Rally Armor mudflaps, which I
installed myself. My new car put a smile on my face every day; even the short
commute to work was a joy.</p>

<p>But I noticed a couple problems. First I noticed that the heated seat bottom on
the driver&rsquo;s side didn&rsquo;t work.  The back worked, but the bottom didn&rsquo;t get warm
at all.  I was annoyed that I hadn&rsquo;t noticed it during the test drive, but it
would be covered by the warranty, so I didn&rsquo;t consider it a big issue. Then, on
the 27th of April, my wife and I went to central Washington to escape the rain
and go hiking.  In contrast to the Seattle area, it was very warm in central
Washington that day, and the interior of the car was boiling from sitting in the
sun when we got back from our first hike of the day.  I turned on the air
conditioning and&hellip;  it was clearly not as cold as it should be.  It was no
colder than the regular air coming in from the exterior. This was even more
bothersome than the heated seat issue, but again I figured that it could be
fixed under warranty, so I didn&rsquo;t worry about it too much.</p>

<p>During the next week I also replaced the air filter (by myself, which I was
pretty proud of, even though it&rsquo;s about the easiest thing to change on a car)
and noticed that the air box had a large crack in it, and that the air intake
duct which goes into the air box had been broken in half height-wise and
shoddily glued back together with some kind of sealant.  I still didn&rsquo;t think
much of it at this point as I figured someone had damaged them while replacing
the air filter previously.</p>

<p>Finally, I booked a service appointment for May 3rd to get the heated seat and
air conditioning fixed at
<a href="http://www.eastsidesubaru.com/index.htm">Eastside Subaru</a> in Kirkland, which
is a lot closer to Redmond than Renton is.  I dropped the car off and they
called me back later in the day to inform me that they verified both of the
issues, but that while the heated seat problem could be fixed under warranty,
the air conditioner couldn&rsquo;t because the condenser had been
<strong>damaged in an accident.</strong></p>

<p>Ugh.</p>

<p>I went back to Eastside Subaru and asked them to point out how they knew it was
accident damage, since Walker&rsquo;s had told me the car had not been in an accident.
The technician who serviced the car came out and pointed out several things to
me.  The tubes from the AC condenser were bent in such a way that it was obvious
to him that there had been an impact, and they leaked badly. Moreover, the
condenser itself was quite obviously bent.  There are tool marks on the bolts
that hold on both of the front quarter panels, indicating that they&rsquo;ve been
removed to be repaired or replaced.  There&rsquo;s an AC recharge sticker on the
inside of the hood which appears to have been glued on, not very well, so it&rsquo;s
peeling off; I believe the technician also said that he thought the whole hood
had likely been replaced.  The power steering fluid reservoir attaches to the
body of the vehicle in two places and one of those was cracked. The radiator
support bar is also bent. It&rsquo;s slight enough that the untrained eye would
probably not notice it, but the technician at Eastside told me, and I am very
confident that these were his exact words<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, that Walker&rsquo;s &ldquo;had to have
known&rdquo; that the vehicle was in an accident.</p>

<p>I drove back down to Renton and spent probably about half an hour yelling at
various people.  Ken tried to placate me in various ways; he told me that they
didn&rsquo;t know and that they couldn&rsquo;t have known; he mentioned that &ldquo;my guy&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t
notice the problem either; he tried to tell me that this wouldn&rsquo;t actually
decrease the resale value of the car (bullshit) and that since it&rsquo;s not on the
CarFax or title no one needs to know anyway. He made repeated use of euphemisms
implying that maybe there <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> actually any damage and the car <em>hadn&rsquo;t</em>
actually been in an accident, even after I <em>showed him</em> the damaged parts. He
seemed to be acting almost as though if I simply willed it hard enough I could
bring about some alternate reality wherein my car was pristine and undamaged.
(Believe me, I tried.) This, to me, emphasizes the problem with people like Ken
and his manager and, as I&rsquo;ll soon describe, his manager&rsquo;s manager&mdash;that is
to say, salespeople&mdash;they have an atypical understanding of the concepts of
<em>facts</em> and <em>truth</em> and act as though reality is open to interpretation.</p>

<p>I told Ken that I refuse to lie to someone when I sell the car (and let this
post be a testament to that, because it is now public knowledge, whether or not
it ever shows up on the CarFax) and that I felt that I was probably out
thousands of dollars in resale value, not to mention the fact that I have no
idea what kind of mechanical issues this could result in down the road. My
confidence in my extended warranty has also gone down the drain, because if
anything fails and can be shown to have signs of accident damage, even if it&rsquo;s
very minor, then it won&rsquo;t be covered.</p>

<p>I made it clear that I wanted them to take the car back and refund me the entire
purchase price including the extended warranty, 3M treatment, and taxes I paid.
That didn&rsquo;t even account for the hundreds of dollars I had already put into the
car (mud flaps, floor mats, air filter, etc); I didn&rsquo;t care, I just wanted to
cancel the transaction and be done with it.  We argued for a while, but it was
fairly late on Friday afternoon and he told me that there was no one at the
dealership who could make that decision at that time. He said that he&rsquo;d get the
general manger to call me back the next day before noon. I asked him to tell the
GM that I would be talking to an attorney if I didn&rsquo;t get the answer I wanted,
and left. From this point until the beginning of June, I completely stopped
driving the car, as I wanted to ensure the strength of my case by minimizing the
number of miles I put on the car.</p>

<p>That Saturday I had plans to go hiking, and I didn&rsquo;t want to cancel them just
for a phone call that probably wouldn&rsquo;t go anywhere, so I called the dealership
early in the morning.  Ken wasn&rsquo;t there yet, but I left a message for him saying
that I may not be available to answer the phone but that he could leave me a
message.  Nobody called me on Saturday, and in fact I haven&rsquo;t spoken to Ken at
all since that Friday, the 3rd of May.  On Monday, the 7th of May, I called back
and asked to speak to the general manager,
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/james-capestany/11/b84/772">James Capestany</a>.  I
ended up having more or less the same conversation with him that I had with Ken.
He was and is adamant that the dealership didn&rsquo;t know that the car was in an
accident, and further, that it&rsquo;s not their responsibility to know.  He pointed
out that the salespeople do not have mechanical qualifications.  I asked him why
his <em>technicians</em> failed to thoroughly inspect a car which costs upwards of
$30,000 when they took it as a trade-in.  He gave me a completely unsatisfactory
answer which I don&rsquo;t quite recall.  I told him that I had read the sale
contract, including the provision for trade-ins which states that the party
trading in the car warrants that it has not had any undisclosed damage requiring
bodywork, and asked why he was screwing me instead of taking the car back and
going after the person who clearly violated that contract when he traded it in.
I don&rsquo;t recall his answer to this question either, except insofar as it also
being unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>As Ken did, the James tried to convince me that the accident wouldn&rsquo;t affect the
resale value of the car that badly.  I said that if he were confident that that
was the case, he should have no problem with me getting it appraised by another
Subaru dealership and then having Walker&rsquo;s compensate me for the difference in
value.  He replied, somewhat angrily I think, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not gonna do that.&rdquo;  I
told him that I held the dealership responsible for their failure to thoroughly
inspect the car, and that I would be talking to a lawyer if they wouldn&rsquo;t refund
me or at least compensate me for the depreciation.  He stated that I could talk
to a lawyer if I wanted to, but that the
<a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.70.180">RCW (i.e. state law) on the matter</a>
states that they are only liable if they don&rsquo;t disclose damage that they know
about, and he reiterated that they did not know.</p>

<p>Even to this date, I am unsure of whether or I believe that. I am a firm
believer in Hanlon&rsquo;s razor (&ldquo;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately
explained by stupidity&rdquo;), but the odds I calculated above make me incredulous
that Kay didn&rsquo;t actually have some record of the accident, in which case they
obviously would have to have known. The dealership has shown me, as &ldquo;proof&rdquo; that
they didn&rsquo;t know, copies of reports run in December of 2012 which indicated that
the car had a clean record. But still, I&rsquo;m incredulous that <em>nobody</em> noticed
the damage before I took the car to Eastside Subaru. The technicians at Walker&rsquo;s
should have done a thorough inspection as Ken and Jan assured me they did, so
either someone lied about the damage, or their technicians neglected to do their
duty, or they are incompetent. And what of the other customers who must have
looked at the vehicle before I did? When I was selling my Civic after I bought
the STI, two of the three people who test drove it had some mechanical
experience and identified some potential issues with the vehicle that I wasn&rsquo;t
aware of. Did nobody more knowledgeable than I look at this STI and notice the
damaged parts?</p>

<p>Either way, I told James that I would be talking to a lawyer.  He told me that
he&rsquo;d try to get in touch with the previous owner of the vehicle, and that he&rsquo;d
pull up the repair order from when it was first traded in to see if they had any
indication that the car may have been in an accident. Ultimately he wasn&rsquo;t able
to get in touch with the previous owner, but I&rsquo;m not sure what difference it
would have made. If that guy had any common sense whatsoever, he would have lied
about the accident since knowingly trading the car in without disclosing the
accident is a violation of the trade in contract.  And even if he had told the
truth, what then? Would Walker&rsquo;s have sued him if <em>he</em> refused to compensate me?
I doubt it.</p>

<p>Later that same day, James called back. He asked me to explain again what
Eastside Subaru told me about the air conditioning.  When I mentioned that they
said they couldn&rsquo;t warranty the part because of accident damage, he said that
that&rsquo;s not true and he didn&rsquo;t know why they&rsquo;d say that.  He said that they just
changed management and probably didn&rsquo;t know what they were doing, and that
Walker&rsquo;s has been in business for 25 years.  He told me if I brought the car
down he would replace the AC condenser under warranty.  I told him that that was
not my primary concern and that it wouldn&rsquo;t be good enough.  He accepted that,
but pointed out that I still needed to get the AC fixed and that he could have
it done under warranty.</p>

<p>Obviously what James told me about the condenser being replaceable under
warranty was not true. I looked it up after I got off that call and
this is what the Subaru warranty says:</p>

<blockquote><p>These warranties do not cover any part
which malfunctions, fails or is damaged due to objects striking the vehicle,
road hazards, whether on or off the road, <strong>accident</strong>, fire, neglect, abuse or
any other cause beyond the control of [Subaru of America].</p></blockquote>

<p>(Emphasis mine.) This is obviously exactly what I expected since no warranty
ever in the history of automobiles, as far as I can fathom, has covered accident
damage.  Otherwise there would be no reason for any type of insurance other than
liability insurance. When I talked to him next I asked James to explain this
discrepancy, and he said that while &ldquo;the letter of&rdquo; the warranty agreement said
one thing, it was open to interpretation and it was a matter of customer service
and reputation to do warranty replacements in situations like this.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m splitting hairs at this point, but what James was offering was <em>not a
warranty replacement</em>, and I know that for a fact because as part of the
eventual resolution of this nightmare, I did get Walker&rsquo;s to replace the
AC condenser, and the amount charged is listed as &ldquo;Internal&rdquo; rather than
&ldquo;Warranty&rdquo; on the service record. I do think the distinction is important
because it means that the dealership, rather than Subaru of America, is paying
for the new part, and it&rsquo;s not a cheap part. Although offering to replace the
condenser is not an admission of <em>legal</em> liability, he obviously would not offer
it if he truly felt that his shop was guiltless in this, because the repair
comes out of his bottom line. So again, he&rsquo;s <strong>directly lying to me,</strong> and
throwing Eastside Subaru under the bus at the same time.</p>

<p>I readily admit to being a bit naÃ¯ve in some respects, but it&rsquo;s still shocking
to me that there are people who will do that.</p>

<h2>Lawyer Up</h2>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t bluffing about talking to a lawyer. I have a group legal plan through
work which covers all my legal fees for applicable issues, which include
consumer protection cases. Unfortunately there is also a downside to the group
legal plan: it somewhat limits one&rsquo;s choice of lawyer, and even among the
limited selection of in-network lawyers within a reasonable distance, many are
very busy. Thus, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that you&rsquo;ll get a <em>good</em> lawyer.</p>

<p>I do not think that I got a good lawyer.</p>

<p>I had to call several lawyers before I was able to find one who would take on
the case. One of the lawyers who called me back but couldn&rsquo;t take the case was
kind enough to provide me with some basic information.  He said that he thought
I had a good case under the Washington state consumer protection law.  He said
that the dealership&rsquo;s failure to thoroughly inspect the car before selling it
and claiming it had not been in an accident could be considered an unlawful
&ldquo;deceptive act&rdquo; under
<a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=19.86.020">RCW 19.86.020</a>.
He also pointed out that the Consumer Protection Act allows for triple damages
up to a maximum of $25,000, which might have been useful leverage in my
discussions with James, but I never actually mentioned it to him  because the
lawyer who eventually took on the case didn&rsquo;t think much of its applicability.</p>

<p>In fact, the lawyer I did eventually end up hiring didn&rsquo;t initially think that I
had a case at all (but didn&rsquo;t tell me this until I had already hired her). She
was essentially in agreement with James that the dealership would only be liable
if they knew about the accident before selling the car to me, and since we would
likely not be able to prove that even if it were true<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>, we would
have no case.</p>

<p>I did some research of my own and discovered a few other laws which might be
applicable. I won&rsquo;t bother mentioning all of them, but I felt that the strongest
was the
<a href="http://www.atg.wa.gov/ConsumerIssues/Cars/UsedCars.aspx#implied_warranty">Implied Warranty of Merchantability</a>.
My understanding is that this state law applies to consumer goods in general,
but as it relates to cars in particular, it states that vehicles sold by
dealerships &ldquo;must be fit for ordinary driving purposes, free of major
defects, reasonably safe, <strong>and of the average quality of similar vehicles
available for sale in that price range.</strong>&rdquo; (Emphasis mine.) In my opinion, given
the depreciation and damaged components, my car obviously did not meet those
standards, but my lawyer still felt that it would be an uphill battle. And of
course, even if I prevailed in arbitration or court, there would be no guarantee
that the dealership would be required to offer anything beyond repairing the AC
condenser.</p>

<p>My lawyer agreed to write a letter to the dealership on my behalf, and that if
they did not respond favourably, we could take them to arbitration. I sent her
all of the documents necessary for the letter on May 15th, and followed up on
May 20th to check on her progress. She told me that she would be working
on the letter soon. I sent her another email on the 24th, but didn&rsquo;t hear back
from her until the 7th of June when I let her know that I would no longer need
her services. Good help is hard to find.</p>

<h2>Resolution</h2>

<p>Luckily lawyers are not the only means of gaining leverage against corporations.
I also contacted <a href="http://www.king5.com/news/get-jesse">Jesse Jones</a> of King 5
News, and filed complaints with Subaru of America, the Better Business Bureau,
and the Washington State Attorney General&rsquo;s office. I didn&rsquo;t get a call back
from Jesse, but the other three seem to have had an effect. I exchanged several
emails with a representative from Subaru who contacted the dealership on my
behalf to try to mediate a resolution. The representative didn&rsquo;t seem to have
much actual power over the dealership, but she was courteous and timely, seemed
sympathetic to my concerns, and made a real effort to do what she could, so I
certainly appreciate that.</p>

<p>The complaint to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office seemed to have more of an effect.
Not long after Walker&rsquo;s received it, James called me back and offered to write
me a cheque to cover some of the depreciation in addition to fixing the air
conditioner, as long as I would sign a document releasing the dealership from
all liability relating to the matter. Given that I had been fighting with the
dealership for a month and that my lawyer had gone <acronym title="Away WithOut
Leave"> AWOL</acronym>, I readily accepted this offer.</p>

<p>I took the car back to Eastside Subaru to determine what the depreciation would
actually be. Given the lack of mechanical damage, the absence of records of the
accident, the fact that the damage was almost completely repaired, and the
rarity of the STI sedan, I was told that the depreciation would probably not be
more than $1,000 to $1,500. This seemed low to me, but I discussed it with a
friend who is very knowledgeable about cars and he felt that it was not
unreasonable. If you disagree with this, please <strong>do not</strong> tell me, because at
this point I don&rsquo;t want to know. (Ignorance is bliss.) I took the car back to
Walker&rsquo;s on the 4th of June, and they ended up fixing the AC condenser and air
intake duct and giving me a cheque for $1,000.</p>

<p>In the interest of fairness I will say that I did have a fairly positive
experience at the Walker&rsquo;s Renton Subaru service department when I took my
vehicle in for the repairs. The service advisor I dealt with,
<a href="http://www.dealerrater.com/sales/Brad-Hallock-review-33465/">Brad Hallock</a>, was
very courteous and helpful. Of course, that doesn&rsquo;t come close to excusing the
rest of my experience with the dealership, particularly given that it was the
Walker&rsquo;s Renton Subaru service technicians who ostensibly inspected the vehicle
when they bought it.  While I was picking up my car after the service was
finished, I overheard another service advisor talking about the &ldquo;world class
inspection&rdquo; that they were going to do for another customer. I was tempted to
interrupt and tell the customer about my experience with their &ldquo;world class
inspection,&rdquo; but to my shame, I&rsquo;m too non-confrontational to do something like
that. It&rsquo;s a flaw that I need to work on.</p>

<p>I am fairly satisfied with the compensation I received, and overjoyed to be able
to put this ordeal behind me. At this point I consider the matter to be closed.
The Attorney General&rsquo;s office has closed their file on the case, and as soon as
Walker&rsquo;s responds to the Better Business Bureau complaint, I will close that as
well. I am looking forward to never having any contact with them again.</p>

<p>That said, I am absolutely not satisfied with how the dealership handled the
issue in the month between my discovering the problem and them finally giving me
some compensation. (Otherwise I would not be writing this, of course.) I spent
far too much time fighting with them. At every juncture I encountered
dishonesty, self-interest, and a complete refusal to accept responsibility for
the failure of their technicians to thoroughly inspect the car. Between
the time I spent playing telephone tag with the general manager, the time to
find and hire a lawyer, the time spent on filing complaints with third parties,
and the disruption of my schedule resulting from the loss of use of my vehicle
for nearly a month<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, I probably wasted more than a dozen hours on this,
and it certainly impacted my productivity at work as well.</p>

<p>When I was buying the car, Ken and Jan repeatedly assured me of the quality of
Walker&rsquo;s inspections and servicing, and the qualifications of their technicians.
When it turned out that those technicians had missed significant accident damage
which was still present on the vehicle and should have been easily discoverable
by a qualified technician, nobody at the dealership would stand behind those
claims of excellence; they repeatedly insisted that they could not have known
and were not responsible. I find this appalling, though I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t find
it shocking. When I asked why they would take such an expensive vehicle as a
trade-in without doing a thorough inspection, I was told that since the CarFax
didn&rsquo;t indicate any problems, they had no reason to suspect that there would be
anything wrong with the vehicle.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why I had to fight with the dealership about this <em>at all</em>.
They should have just refunded the sale completely as soon as I raised the issue
with them, and gone after the original owner to recoup their losses, who was
<em>clearly</em> in violation of his sale contract.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>I hope this doesn&rsquo;t sound histrionic, because it is completely genuine, but I
was also emotionally affected by all of this. I tend to be very trusting and
give people the benefit of the doubt with respect to their motivations. I am
ill-equipped to deal with salespeople because I am not naturally inclined to
assume that someone will mislead me and take advantage of me out of
self-interest. I expect cold, detached, exploitative behaviour from large
corporations, but Walker&rsquo;s really isn&rsquo;t that large, and these were <em>real people</em>
with whom I had face-to-face conversations, who had the power to do the right
thing but were unwilling to. The whole experience has made me more cynical.
Moreover, the feeling I hate more than any other is powerlessness, and I found
it simultaneously frustrating and discouraging to be in a situation where for a
long time I seemed to have practically no recourse against the dealership for
the losses I&rsquo;d suffered due to their incompetence.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll never again enjoy my car as much I did for the first two months I owned it,
and although I&rsquo;ve been reassured that Subarus are built like tanks, I&rsquo;m not
sure I&rsquo;ll be able to completely get past the paranoia that every tiny creak or
shudder might be forewarning of some impending catastrophic failure. But on the
bright side, I do still love the car. I was worried that I&rsquo;d hate it after all
of this because of the negative associations with all the time I wasted and
frustration I experienced, but that isn&rsquo;t the case. It&rsquo;s still a ton of fun to
drive. I&rsquo;m looking forward to finally taking it on its inaugural road trip, to
modding it and making it my own, and to spending many hours &ldquo;going Subaruing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, with every negative experience comes the silver lining of life lessons to be
learned, and this is no different. Here are my takeaways from this:</p>

<ul>
<li>A clean record from CarFax and other similar services is completely
meaningless. Anything not reported to insurance or the police will not show
up on a CarFax report, and in my case, I have reason to believe that an
insurance claim and police report <em>were</em> made for the accident my vehicle
was in, and CarFax <em>still</em> shows nothing<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Mechanics can be similarly unreliable. Ideally one should have a trusted
mechanic whom they&rsquo;ve dealt with previously. I haven&rsquo;t lived in Washginton
long enough to know any mechanics well, so I should have asked friends who
are knowledgeable about cars for recommendations instead of just picking one
based on Yelp reviews.</li>
<li>Even if you don&rsquo;t know much about cars, there are certain things you can
look for under the hood when buying a used car which may indicate that the
vehicle was in an accident or had bodywork done. Check for tool marks (i.e.
missing paint) on the bolts under the hood. Check for damaged plastic
components. Some vehicles (although I don&rsquo;t think mine is among them,
unfortunately) have the VIN stamped on major components; if any of the VINs
are missing or don&rsquo;t match, something is up.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not sure if this is a fair generalization based on this one experience,
but if I were to buy another used car I would be very suspicious of vehicles
which are overdue for important maintenance, as it may indicate that the
seller did not thoroughly inspect the vehicle or does not care to maintain
it himself.</li>
<li>I am by no means an expert negotiator so take this with a grain of salt as
well, but I suspect that immediate face-to-face negotiation is not the best
way to go. It suggests a desire to buy a vehicle quickly, and the more time
one spends negotiating, the less willing one will be to walk away due to the
lost investment of time. It is probably better to tell the dealership what
you are willing to pay and immediately leave if they won&rsquo;t meet that demand.
Either they&rsquo;ll call you back with a good offer, or you can continue to look
elsewhere.</li>
<li>Buying a new car means suffering immediate depreciation, but it&rsquo;s also much
less likely to result in nasty surprises like this. Many states have lemon
laws to protect new car buyers from troublesome cars, but these rarely apply
to used cars. Consider whether this tradeoff is worthwhile. Personally, I&rsquo;ll
definitely be looking at new cars next time I buy a vehicle.</li>
<li>And most importantly, when legal options don&rsquo;t pan out, the best way to get
what you want from a corporation may simply be to be persistent and annoying
enough that it becomes worth their money to solve your issue just to make
you go away.</li>
</ul>

<p>The STI is only available with a six-speed manual transmission, but I was specifically looking for a manual car anyway. One might wonder why I&rsquo;d seek out a manual even when I hardly knew how to drive them.  The answer is that I&rsquo;d always been intrigued by manual transmissions, and after taking a quick lesson I was set on buying a manual because I found it to be a lot of fun. Plus, without simply jumping in and buying a manual car, one has limited opportunity to learn&mdash;you can only spend so much time borrowing friends&#8217; vehicles, and lessons are expensive.  (For those of you outside of North America, manuals are fairly rare here, accounting for less than 7% of yearly sales. They can&rsquo;t be rented at all because most people, particularly younger people, don&rsquo;t know how to drive them, so the rental companies would be constantly replacing burnt-out clutches and ground up gears if they did offer manual vehicles.) Unfortunately, being inexperienced at driving manual may have influenced me to make the purchase faster than I otherwise might have, as it&rsquo;s embarrassing to go on a test drive and stall the car several times, and I was worried that if I couldn&rsquo;t borrow a car to practice before subsequent test drives I&rsquo;d do an even worse job of it.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In September I <a href="/entry/2012/09/14/social-networks-and-content-ownership/">wrote about</a>
my intention to develop a web application to share my photos. I made good
progress on it throughout September and early October, but for various reasons I
haven&rsquo;t been able to work on it much in the past month or so. Last weekend,
though, I was able to solve some blocking issues which were preventing me from
doing an alpha release. Those being dealt with, I&rsquo;ve now got a few of my albums
up at <a href="http://photos.mlindgren.ca/">photos.mlindgren.ca</a>; take a look and leave
a comment if you have any feedback.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t released the source code yet as there&rsquo;s still a great deal of work to
be done, and I&rsquo;m generally of the belief that dumping a bunch of unfinished,
messy code on Github with the hope that the community will sort it out is of
little benefit to anyone. My goal at this point is to do a beta release in a
two to three months or so and release the code at that point. That timeline is
anything but firm, though. This project is turning out to be much more work than
I expected (as projects are wont to do), and I expect to be fairly busy over the
next couple months.</p>

<p>Anyway, with the alpha version up and running, this seems like a good
opportunity to reflect on some of the issues I&rsquo;ve faced that complicated the
project, and on what remains to be done.</p>

<h2>Wand and the OOM Killer</h2>

<p>I mentioned in my
<a href="/entry/2012/09/14/the-state-of-python-imaging/">post on Python imaging libraries</a>
that I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://dahlia.kr/wand/index.html">Wand</a> to resize and transform
uploaded photos. It&rsquo;s very convenient and easy to use, and from a
maintainability and ease of use perspective I much prefer using Python bindings
for ImageMagick to shelling out to the ImageMagick executable. One
of my goals for this project is that other people should be able to install it
on their own servers with relative ease, and I suspect relying on ImageMagick
executables for image processing would lead to cross-platform and configuration
issues.</p>

<p>But, Wand is not yet a mature library and it has some significant issues of its
own. First and foremost, when I started using it it had some major memory
leaks. I found and fixed more than 10 leaks and submitted a pull request which
was merged into the main repository&mdash;however, there hasn&rsquo;t yet been an
official release including my fixes yet, so pip installs and downloads from the
Wand website will still include those leaks.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I got all of the leaks or if more still remain. The ones I fixed
were discovered mostly through ad-hoc testing and reading the code. I&rsquo;ve been
running my app for several days now and the memory consumption when it&rsquo;s idle
has stayed flat, so I believe I&rsquo;ve removed at least the most common leaks, but I
haven&rsquo;t had a chance to sit down with Valgrind yet and run the Wand unit tests
through it to make sure that I got <em>all</em> of the leaks. I&rsquo;ll have to do that
before I do any sort of public release of my software;
I don&rsquo;t want to rely on a leaky library.</p>

<p>Beyond the leaks, I ran into another memory issue which proved problematic:
resizing photographs can use a great deal of memory, which is extremely limited
on a reasonably-priced <acronym title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</acronym>.
I have limited knowledge about image processing in general and ImageMagick in
particular, but I&rsquo;m not aware of any resizing algorithms which can operate
directly on compressed image data, and if any such algorithms exist, ImageMagick
doesn&rsquo;t use them. That being the case, to resize an image, the entire image has
to be loaded into memory decompressed. For an 8 megapixel photograph at 24 bits
per pixel, that means allocating approximately 183MB of memory.</p>

<p>On a 512MB VPS, this means that trying to resize three images
concurrently&mdash;or even sequentially in some cases, since Python isn&rsquo;t
guaranteed to immediately relinquish allocated memory to the operating system
when objects resident in that memory are &ldquo;deleted&rdquo;&mdash;practically guarantees
that the process will be killed by the
<acronym title="Out Of Memory">OOM</acronym> killer.</p>

<p>This goes hand in hand with another complication, which is that resizing images
is too slow to be done in the same server thread that&rsquo;s handling requests and
generating responses. For each image that&rsquo;s uploaded, I save several different
sizes for different purposes, and due to the aforementioned memory constraints I
can&rsquo;t even resize them concurrently. Resizing each image several times in the
responding thread drastically reduces throughput for the client
since it incurs a significant wait time for the server to process each image
after it&rsquo;s uploaded.</p>

<h2>Enter Subprocess</h2>

<p>So here&rsquo;s the solution I&rsquo;ve come up with for the time being, and I&rsquo;m very unsure
whether or not it&rsquo;s actually a good solution, so please do let me know in the
comments if there&rsquo;s a better way to do this.  When a new image is uploaded, the
responding thread saves the image in the appropriate directory and adds it to
the database, but does not resize it.  For each of the sizes that the image
needs to be resized to, it adds a task to a
<a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/queue.html">synchronous queue</a>. The queue is
consumed by a different thread which runs throughout the lifetime of the
application. That thread maintains a (thread-local) queue of
<a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html">subprocesses</a> with a
configurable maximum length. When a new resizing task is consumed, if there is
room in the subprocess queue, a new subprocess is spawned to resize the image.
Otherwise, the thread joins the subprocess at the front of the queue so as to
block until there&rsquo;s room to spawn a new subprocess. The exit code of completed
processes is checked to ensure that the resize was successful; in case of
failure, the task is re-added to the back of the task queue.</p>

<p>This guarantees that the application server itself will never be killed by the
OOM killer since it uses minimal memory. It never has to load images into
memory; all of that is done in the resizing subprocesses.  By configuring the
maximum number of concurrent subprocesses, one can scale this solution according
to available resources: if you have plenty of RAM, you can resize many images
concurrently and get through the queue faster, or if you have very little, you
can limit the queue to one or two processes to minimize the chance that anything
will be OOM killed.</p>

<p>The subprocess spawning notwithstanding, this is a pretty standard task queue
model, so you might be wondering why I didn&rsquo;t use something like
<a href="http://celeryproject.org/">Celery</a> in conjunction with a real message queue.
It comes down to minimizing the number of external dependencies and maximizing
ease of use. My project already depends on a number of libraries which will have
to be installed by users. To the greatest extent that I can do so without
compromising on features, I want to avoid complicating the installation further
by adding more dependencies. Celery is particularly difficult to install as it
requires installing and configuring a broker and managing processes for both the
broker and Celery itself. Were I writing a large-scale service and maintaining a
single backend for hundreds of users, it would probably be the right choice, but
as I am writing software for users to install on their own servers, it is
probably not.</p>

<p>This method works fairly well and it&rsquo;s the best I&rsquo;ve come up with so far, but
something about it makes it feel more like a hack than a well thought out and
robust solution. I also wonder if it defeats the purpose of using Wand in the
first place; I use it for very little other than resizing, and since I&rsquo;m going
to the trouble of spawning subprocesses to do that, perhaps it would actually be
better to just directly invoke the ImageMagick binaries. As mentioned above, I
have concerns about what impact that would have in different environments, but I
haven&rsquo;t really validated those concerns; they&rsquo;re just hunches.</p>

<h2>The Road Ahead</h2>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve got a workable, if not perfect, solution to one of the biggest problems
I encountered&hellip; but as I mentioned previously, there&rsquo;s still much work to be
done. Here are a few (but not all) of the things I&rsquo;d like to do before I release
anything publicly:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lots of UI work.</strong> Right now the app works very poorly on phones and iPads.
I also need to figure out how to make certain features more discoverable, and
although I&rsquo;m happy with how albums look right now, there are still some extra
touches that I want to add which I haven&rsquo;t yet been able to (because CSS and
HTML suck.)</li>
<li><strong>Better administrative tools.</strong> Uploading works great, but I have very
barebones interfaces for editing albums right now. There is currently no means
of rotating a photo from the editing interface (although doing so should
almost never be necessary since the app automatically rotates images which
have EXIF orientation data.)</li>
<li><strong>Mirroring and proxying to cloud storage services</strong> such as Azure and S3. VPS
resources are very expensive; extra disk space on some popular hosts runs
around a dollar per gigabyte per month. That&rsquo;s ten times the cost of disk
space on the cloud storage services I&rsquo;ve looked at. Cloud-hosted images might
also improve load speeds for visitors.</li>
<li><strong>Comments.</strong> This one is pretty big, obviously, but I haven&rsquo;t added it yet
because I can&rsquo;t decide on how best to handle it. I&rsquo;d like to avoid writing my
own comment system and requiring potential commenters to sign up for yet
another account. (I&rsquo;d use Persona for commenter identification and
authentication just as I do for the admin login, but very few people currently
have Persona accounts or even know what it is.) I like Disqus, but I&rsquo;m not
sure it would integrate well with the minimalist interface I&rsquo;ve designed.</li>
<li><strong>Geotagging and maps.</strong> I&rsquo;m already reading GPS data from EXIF tags where
available, but now I need to do something with it. I&rsquo;d like to add the ability
to manually add locations to photos and albums, and to have a map that shows
where photos were taken.</li>
</ul>


<p>Those five items represent maybe a quarter to a third of the work I still have
planned, so to repeat myself again, there&rsquo;s a lot of work to do. But I&rsquo;m very
happy with the progress I&rsquo;ve made so far, and I feel confident that I can get
this finished. It&rsquo;s just a matter of when.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>David Somers presents an
<a href="http://labs.newsint.co.uk/blog/2012/10/why-mozilla-persona-is-the-right-answer-to-the-question-of-identity/">excellent rundown</a>
of what
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/">Mozilla Persona</a> is and why it&rsquo;s
currently the best option for identity and authentication for web services. I&rsquo;ve
implemented authentication using Persona in the
<a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2012/09/14/social-networks-and-content-ownership/">photo album app</a>
I&rsquo;m working on, and I found it remarkably easy to integrate with my app. And, as
David explains, Persona is also much easier for users to understand than
competing platforms like OpenID. If you&rsquo;re a web developer, you really need to
add Persona support to your application as soon as
possible. It can be done in literally a matter of minutes, and if Persona takes
off the benefit to identity management on the Internet could be huge.</p>

<p>Perhaps my favourite thing about Persona is that it gives me the opportunity to
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Persona/Implementing_a_Persona_IdP">implement my own identity provider</a>,
which means I can have <em>complete</em> control over how I authenticate to any
Persona-consuming service. I could have <em>n</em>-factor authentication, with no limit
on the complexity or specificity of the factors besides my own imagination. For
example, I could generate SSL client certificates for each of my machines and
hardcode their thumbprints into my identity provider to ensure that it wouldn&rsquo;t
even service requests from machines I haven&rsquo;t explicitly added.  Or if I wanted
to get creative, I could have my identity provider generate a random temporary
key which I would have to retrieve via SSH (but this is less convenient and
probably also less secure than doing SSL client authentication.) The
possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>Perhaps an end is finally in sight to the frustration of having dozens upon
dozens of different accounts and passwords for various services,
<a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2011/12/04/fuck-passwords/">each with its own uniquely nonsensical password composition policy</a>.  Everyone needs to implement Persona&mdash;preferably yesterday.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Backstory</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Wordpress on various sites that I&rsquo;ve maintained for probably the
better part of a decade now. By most metrics, it&rsquo;s still very good blogging
software; I&rsquo;m not aware of any self-hostable alternative that can match
Wordpress in terms of the union of ease of use, feature set and flexibility that
it provides. That said, lately I&rsquo;ve been feeling that perhaps Wordpress is no
longer the right choice for my specific needs. These are my problems with it:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not very good for sharing source code. There are a multitude of plugins
available for syntax highlighting; the best of them seems to be
<a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">Alex Gorbatchev&rsquo;s Syntax Highlighter</a>,
which is used by
<a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> and is also what I was using on my blog.
But I&rsquo;ve had problems with the Wordpress converting some of the characters in
my code to HTML entities (e.g. <code>&amp;amp;</code> for &amp; ) which are then printed
literally by the plugin.</li>
<li>I find that more often than not Wordpress&#8217; visual editor is
insufficient for the formatting I want in my posts. That forces me to use
the raw HTML editor. That would be fine, except that Wordpress has a strange
sort of off-spec way of storing post HTML. Paragraph and line break tags are
omitted in the editor and the database, and are added when the page is
actually rendered to the client. This is okay, I guess, and I <em>think</em>
Wordpress is smart enough to not insert extra paragraph tags if you do wrap
your own paragraphs with them. Still, it leads to some unpredictability with
regard to how a post with hand-written HTML will actually be rendered.</li>
<li>A similar but worse problem occurs when you try to insert extra line breaks.
Even if you&rsquo;re using the raw HTML editor to insert <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> tags, Wordpress
will just get rid of them unless you insert additional non-breaking spaces
(<code>&amp;nbsp;</code>) so that it thinks the lines are non-empty. But! If you switch back
to the visual editor for any reason, even your <code>&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;</code> lines will be
wiped out. Even for &ldquo;average&rdquo; users I can&rsquo;t think of any situation in which
this &ldquo;feature&rdquo; would be desirable. If I put a bunch of extra newlines into
something I&rsquo;m writing, it is because <em>I want exactly that many newlines.</em> I
tend to not have much patience for software that thinks it&rsquo;s smarter than
I am; that is why I still write most of my code in <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>
and use hand-written makefiles in an age of
<acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym>s.</li>
<li>Never-ending updates. It seems like every time I log in there&rsquo;s a new update
to download. Wordpress has updates down to a one-click install process, so
this wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a problem except for the fact that
every time I have to update Wordpress warns me that I should back up my
database first. Why? Is there a significant possibility that the update might
break everything? It&rsquo;s probably just a
<acronym title="Cover Our Asses">COA</acronym>, and I back up my database
daily anyway, but this whole aspect of Wordpress makes me uneasy and I don&rsquo;t
want to have to deal with it any more. Even though I&rsquo;m covered for backups,
recovering from a botched update would undoubtedly be a nightmare.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress#Vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities.</a> One
of the big reasons that Wordpress is updated so frequently is that it has a
long history of security vulnerabilities, and more are still being discovered
and patched. This also means that if I don&rsquo;t log in frequently enough to
download new security patches, I&rsquo;m at risk of having my site compromised,
loaded up with malware and blacklisted by Google.</li>
<li><p>It&rsquo;s written in PHP. <a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">PHP sucks.</a>
(I can&rsquo;t link to that enough.) I don&rsquo;t want to be dogmatic about technology
choices; good software is good software regardless of what language it&rsquo;s
written in, and my primary desire is always to use whatever is best for the
task at hand. But lately I&rsquo;ve been pretty vocal, both here and in person with
friends and colleagues, about how bad PHP is. Continuing to rely on it
undermines my credibility on the issue and makes me a bit of a hypocrite.</p>

<p>And while this might seem trivial or pedantic, it&rsquo;s
actually one of the root causes of almost all of the issues above; the weird
HTML handling, inappropriate entity conversion, and security issues are all
due, at least in part, to bad design patterns popularized and perpetuated by
PHP. Wordpress still uses raw non-parameterized SQL queries; blogging software
built on a modern web framework with a proper
<acronym title="Object-Relational Mapping">ORM</acronym>
would not be plagued by SQL
injection exploits as Wordpress has been historically and probably continues
to be.</p></li>
<li>Wordpress supports themes so that you can customize the apperance of your
site, but editing them kind of sucks, because they&rsquo;re all written in PHP
instead of a proper templating language. Years ago I actually wrote a lot of
PHP, but I still find Wordpress templates pretty ugly and difficult to
understand; they seem more verbose than should really be necessary for what
they accomplish, and have, on average, more <code>&lt;?php ?&gt;</code> sections than a
keyboard has keys. (That analogy sucked. Sorry, it&rsquo;s late. What I&rsquo;m trying to
say is that there are a lot of them.)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Octopress</h2>

<p>So recently I got it into my head to switch over to
<a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress.</a> Octopress bills itself as &ldquo;a blogging
framework for hackers,&rdquo; which is an attractive description given my
<a href="/categories/coding">predilections.</a> It uses
<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> to generate static pages from a set
of templates and content written in
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown.</a><sup>1</sup> It is,
without a doubt, harder to use than to Wordpress, but it has the following
advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rendering static pages once and serving dynamic content via AJAX is much more
efficient than rendering entire pages dynamically for each visitor. This isn&rsquo;t
really a concern for me because this is a very low-traffic site, and I have an
entire quad-core <acronym title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</acronym>
doing basically nothing besides serving this site. That said, it&rsquo;s nice to
know that when I start doing other stuff on my VPS, I won&rsquo;t be contending for
cycles with PHP and MySQL, so the site will always be very responsive. Plus,
wow does the site load fast now (once you have that huge header image cached,
anyway. I&rsquo;ll fix that soon.) Also not a huge concern for a blog, but I
didn&rsquo;t expect the difference to even be noticeable, and it definitely is.</li>
<li>Static pages significantly decrease the attack surface of the site; there is
no database, so no SQL injection to worry about, and no scripts are being
executed, so <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/520827">PHP vulnerabilities</a>
aren&rsquo;t a concern.</li>
<li>Static pages means I get a nicely organized, easily navigable directory
structure instead of God-awful rewrite rules.</li>
<li>The default Octopress theme is very well designed and well-suited to
customization.  I was able to modify it to make it look almost exactly like my
old custom Wordpress theme did, while retaining the fully fluid layout of the
Octopress theme&mdash;meaning that the layout will resize to look beautiful at
any screen resolution, including on mobile devices.</li>
<li>Octopress has pretty nice built in Github and Twitter widgets.</li>
<li>Comments are handled by <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>, which provides a nicer
comment system than Wordpress&#8217; built in comments.  I was using Disqus anyway
via a plugin, but now I don&rsquo;t have to worry about keeping the Disqus comments
synced with the Wordpress database. Incidentally, Disqus provides a very nice
system to migrate comments to new URLs by uploading a
<acronym title="Comma Separate Value">CSV</acronym> file mapping old URLs to
new URLs. They&rsquo;ve really thought of everything, so props to them for providing
a great service.</li>
<li>All of the blog content is stored on my local machine, which means I can write
posts in a disconnected environment using Vim, version control them with Git,
and then push them to my server when they&rsquo;re finished. I have a nice
deployment setup where everything is stored in a Git repository on the server
and a post-commit hook copies the updated content to the web root for the blog
subdomain. All I have to do is <code>git push</code> and the blog is instantly updated.</li>
<li>Since Wordpress uses hand-written SQL queries, it is tightly coupled with
MySQL and doesn&rsquo;t support any other database. PHP is similarly tied to Apache;
while it&rsquo;s possible to run it with other servers, it&rsquo;s not particularly easy.
By ditching Wordpress, I can also get rid of Apache, PHP and MySQL. This is
nice since I was planning to use nginx and Postgres for my
<a href="/entry/2012/09/14/social-networks-and-content-ownership/">photo album project</a>
anyway.</li>
</ul>


<p>Those are, give or take a few minor considerations, my reasons for switching
blogging platforms. I&rsquo;d be remiss to not mention that Octopress does have some
noteworthy disadvantages even for &ldquo;power users&rdquo; to whom the above advantages
might sound attractive.
<a href="http://alblue.bandlem.com/2012/02/disadvantages-of-octopress.html" title="Disadvantages of Octopress - AlBlue's Blog">This post</a>
does a good job cataloguing a few of them. On the balance, though, I feel like
it&rsquo;s a good choice for me, and although the switch took me considerably longer
than I expected (the better part of an weekend where I&rsquo;d expected an evening or
so of work), I&rsquo;m pretty happy that I did it.</p>

<p>In an upcoming post, I&rsquo;ll discuss the actual process of reconfiguring my server
and importing all of my content (which is what I had planned to do before this
turned into a 1,600 word diatribe against Wordpress.) For now, if I&rsquo;ve inspired
you and you&rsquo;re thinking about switching your own Wordpress site to Octopress,
you can take a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/mlindgren/wp2octopress"><acronym title="Extract, Transform, Load">ETL</acronym> I wrote</a>
to ease the import process.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <small>Did you know that Markdown was created by John Gruber? Until very
recently, I didn&rsquo;t. And here I thought all he did was play apologist for
Apple.</small></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m not usually much enamoured with interview-style programming puzzles because I find that a lot of them are actually more akin to math problems, trivial to implement once you figure out the salient mathematical property. Â I think I have a decent intuition for math, and I certainly took enough math courses in high school and college to give me a solid foundation in the fundamentals of algebra, geometry, statistics, calculus, etc., but I&rsquo;m not confident enough in my math skills to be entirely comfortable being judged by my ability to exercise them.<!--more--></p>

<p>There are some programming puzzles I really enjoy, though.

<p>As you can see, the solution is actually very simple, but there are a couple of tricks necessary to make it work.  First of all, you obviously can&rsquo;t use a loop to count the characters because a loop requires a conditional jump to either terminate or continue.  You could still use a loop-like construct such as <code>goto</code>, but that only reframes the problem; you still need to make a decision about when to jump out.</p>

<p>So, the problem can basically be reduced to this: how can you make a decision without using a conditional?  Well, you can index into an array of possibilities using some property that you can derive from your input.  In this case, the most important property is that the characters can be grouped into two sets: terminating characters (i.e. <code>&lsquo;\0&rsquo;</code>) and non-terminating characters (all others).  On that basis, our array of possibilites can consist of two function pointers, one which continues recursively and the other which terminates.</p>

<p>The only problem remaining is how to group the characters, again without using conditionals.  My first thought here was actually to divide the character by itself, in which case all non-terminating characters would be 1, and the null terminator would be&hellip; oh, a divide-by-zero error. I quickly dismissed that thought and realized that binary not is a simpler way to map the characters.  However, Eevee came up with what I think is <a href="https://gist.github.com/3746130" title="Eevee's solution on Github" target="_blank">a very clever and quite unorthodox solution</a> involving division by handling the <code>SIGFPE</code> generated by the division by zero and using the handler to change an unconditional jump address.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d recommend also checking out the solutions provided in the <a title="Reversing the Interview Process - Exodus Intelligence" href="http://blog.exodusintel.com/2012/09/18/reversing-the-interview-process/" target="_blank">original post</a>; all three of them are a bit more elegant than mine, if perhaps a bit more difficult to understand.  (In particular, the count parameter that I use is superfluous, although I don&rsquo;t consider the difference particularly important since it can easily be hidden in my solution using a macro or helper function.)</p>

<p>Since my solution isn&rsquo;t significantly different from those presented in the original post, I wanted to go a bit further and take a look at the performance implications of not using conditionals.  Yeah, yeah, premature optimization is the root of all evil and all that&mdash;I&rsquo;m just doing this out of curiosity; regardless of the results, I would never go this far out of my way to avoid a conditional jump in a real program, nor would I recommend doing so to anyone else.    I decided to compare my solution above against a naÃ¯ve implementation with a while loop; comparing it against <code>strlen()</code> from <code>string.h</code> would be pretty meaningless because it would be linked against a precompiled library which, for all I know, could be hand-optimized.  So here&rsquo;s the code I&rsquo;m using instead:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m assigning the result to a volatile int to ensure that even when the code is optimized, the compiler won&rsquo;t completely optimize out the function call.  So, first, predictions: anyone who has taken a computer architecture course will tell you that conditional jumps can be very expensive because of the recovery the CPU has to do if the branch is mispredicted.  However, branch predictors typically have very high accuracy, and there&rsquo;s also a significant overhead involved in putting the parameters and return address on the stack when a function is called.  Therefore, I predict that in that with no compiler optimization, the while loop will be faster.</p>

<p>&hellip;And, it is.  Running each function in a loop 100,000 times on a 23-character string, the average over five trials was 28,699 Âµsec for the non-conditional version and 9,012 Âµsec for the while loop.  Using a fixed string will cause the branch predictor to have near-perfect accuracy in the while loop version, so there might be a slight difference if I used a large array of strings of randomized lengths, but I doubt it would be significant.</p>

<p>But what if we let the compiler (llvm-gcc in this case) optimize it?  I don&rsquo;t know enough about compiler optimization in general or llvm-gcc in particular to predict what will happen here.  The non-conditional <code>strlen()</code> is tail recursive so the compiler will optimize out the extra function calls at <code>-O2</code> and above, but what will be optimized beyond that I really don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>As it turns out, compiling at <code>-O3</code> and running 100,000 times on the same 23-character string, the non-conditional function took an average of 11,182 Âµsec over five trials.  That&rsquo;s a significant improvement, but it&rsquo;s still slower than the unoptimized while loop, so it obviously won&rsquo;t beat that.  And indeed, the optimized while loop takes only 3,072 Âµsec.</p>
