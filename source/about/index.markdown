I'm a recent graduate in Computing Science from the University of Alberta and a
Canadian expat currently working for Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. I'm
passionate about snowboarding, hiking, music, programming, and all manners of
technology. I use this site to publish pretty much everything I write that's
fit for public consumption, as well as to catalogue my projects and serve as the
canonical source of my online identity. The opinions expressed here are my own
and do not represent the views of my employers or colleagues, past or present.
