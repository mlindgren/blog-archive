  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Backstory</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using Wordpress on various sites that I&#8217;ve maintained for probably the
better part of a decade now. By most metrics, it&#8217;s still very good blogging
software; I&#8217;m not aware of any self-hostable alternative that can match
Wordpress in terms of the union of ease of use, feature set and flexibility that
it provides. That said, lately I&#8217;ve been feeling that perhaps Wordpress is no
longer the right choice for my specific needs. These are my problems with it:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s not very good for sharing source code. There are a multitude of plugins
available for syntax highlighting; the best of them seems to be
<a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">Alex Gorbatchev&#8217;s Syntax Highlighter</a>,
which is used by
<a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> and is also what I was using on my blog.
But I&#8217;ve had problems with the Wordpress converting some of the characters in
my code to HTML entities (e.g. <code>&amp;amp;</code> for &amp; ) which are then printed
literally by the plugin.</li>
<li>I find that more often than not Wordpress&#8217; visual editor is
insufficient for the formatting I want in my posts. That forces me to use
the raw HTML editor. That would be fine, except that Wordpress has a strange
sort of off-spec way of storing post HTML. Paragraph and line break tags are
omitted in the editor and the database, and are added when the page is
actually rendered to the client. This is okay, I guess, and I <em>think</em>
Wordpress is smart enough to not insert extra paragraph tags if you do wrap
your own paragraphs with them. Still, it leads to some unpredictability with
regard to how a post with hand-written HTML will actually be rendered.</li>
<li>A similar but worse problem occurs when you try to insert extra line breaks.
Even if you&#8217;re using the raw HTML editor to insert <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> tags, Wordpress
will just get rid of them unless you insert additional non-breaking spaces
(<code>&amp;nbsp;</code>) so that it thinks the lines are non-empty. But! If you switch back
to the visual editor for any reason, even your <code>&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;</code> lines will be
wiped out. Even for &#8220;average&#8221; users I can&#8217;t think of any situation in which
this &#8220;feature&#8221; would be desirable. If I put a bunch of extra newlines into
something I&#8217;m writing, it is because <em>I want exactly that many newlines.</em> I
tend to not have much patience for software that thinks it&#8217;s smarter than
I am; that is why I still write most of my code in <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>
and use hand-written makefiles in an age of
<acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym>s.</li>
<li>Never-ending updates. It seems like every time I log in there&#8217;s a new update
to download. Wordpress has updates down to a one-click install process, so
this wouldn&#8217;t be much of a problem except for the fact that
every time I have to update Wordpress warns me that I should back up my
database first. Why? Is there a significant possibility that the update might
break everything? It&#8217;s probably just a
<acronym title="Cover Our Asses">COA</acronym>, and I back up my database
daily anyway, but this whole aspect of Wordpress makes me uneasy and I don&#8217;t
want to have to deal with it any more. Even though I&#8217;m covered for backups,
recovering from a botched update would undoubtedly be a nightmare.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress#Vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities.</a> One
of the big reasons that Wordpress is updated so frequently is that it has a
long history of security vulnerabilities, and more are still being discovered
and patched. This also means that if I don&#8217;t log in frequently enough to
download new security patches, I&#8217;m at risk of having my site compromised,
loaded up with malware and blacklisted by Google.</li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s written in PHP. <a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">PHP sucks.</a>
(I can&#8217;t link to that enough.) I don&#8217;t want to be dogmatic about technology
choices; good software is good software regardless of what language it&#8217;s
written in, and my primary desire is always to use whatever is best for the
task at hand. But lately I&#8217;ve been pretty vocal, both here and in person with
friends and colleagues, about how bad PHP is. Continuing to rely on it
undermines my credibility on the issue and makes me a bit of a hypocrite.</p>

<p>And while this might seem trivial or pedantic, it&#8217;s
actually one of the root causes of almost all of the issues above; the weird
HTML handling, inappropriate entity conversion, and security issues are all
due, at least in part, to bad design patterns popularized and perpetuated by
PHP. Wordpress still uses raw non-parameterized SQL queries; blogging software
built on a modern web framework with a proper
<acronym title="Object-Relational Mapping">ORM</acronym>
would not be plagued by SQL
injection exploits as Wordpress has been historically and probably continues
to be.</p></li>
<li>Wordpress supports themes so that you can customize the apperance of your
site, but editing them kind of sucks, because they&#8217;re all written in PHP
instead of a proper templating language. Years ago I actually wrote a lot of
PHP, but I still find Wordpress templates pretty ugly and difficult to
understand; they seem more verbose than should really be necessary for what
they accomplish, and have, on average, more <code>&lt;?php ?&gt;</code> sections than a
keyboard has keys. (That analogy sucked. Sorry, it&#8217;s late. What I&#8217;m trying to
say is that there are a lot of them.)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Octopress</h2>

<p>So recently I got it into my head to switch over to
<a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress.</a> Octopress bills itself as &#8220;a blogging
framework for hackers,&#8221; which is an attractive description given my
<a href="/categories/coding">predilections.</a> It uses
<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> to generate static pages from a set
of templates and content written in
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown.</a><sup>1</sup> It is,
without a doubt, harder to use than to Wordpress, but it has the following
advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rendering static pages once and serving dynamic content via AJAX is much more
efficient than rendering entire pages dynamically for each visitor. This isn&#8217;t
really a concern for me because this is a very low-traffic site, and I have an
entire quad-core <acronym title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</acronym>
doing basically nothing besides serving this site. That said, it&#8217;s nice to
know that when I start doing other stuff on my VPS, I won&#8217;t be contending for
cycles with PHP and MySQL, so the site will always be very responsive. Plus,
wow does the site load fast now (once you have that huge header image cached,
anyway. I&#8217;ll fix that soon.) Also not a huge concern for a blog, but I
didn&#8217;t expect the difference to even be noticeable, and it definitely is.</li>
<li>Static pages significantly decrease the attack surface of the site; there is
no database, so no SQL injection to worry about, and no scripts are being
executed, so <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/520827">PHP vulnerabilities</a>
aren&#8217;t a concern.</li>
<li>Static pages means I get a nicely organized, easily navigable directory
structure instead of God-awful rewrite rules.</li>
<li>The default Octopress theme is very well designed and well-suited to
customization.  I was able to modify it to make it look almost exactly like my
old custom Wordpress theme did, while retaining the fully fluid layout of the
Octopress theme&mdash;meaning that the layout will resize to look beautiful at
any screen resolution, including on mobile devices.</li>
<li>Octopress has pretty nice built in Github and Twitter widgets.</li>
<li>Comments are handled by <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>, which provides a nicer
comment system than Wordpress&#8217; built in comments.  I was using Disqus anyway
via a plugin, but now I don&#8217;t have to worry about keeping the Disqus comments
synced with the Wordpress database. Incidentally, Disqus provides a very nice
system to migrate comments to new URLs by uploading a
<acronym title="Comma Separate Value">CSV</acronym> file mapping old URLs to
new URLs. They&#8217;ve really thought of everything, so props to them for providing
a great service.</li>
<li>All of the blog content is stored on my local machine, which means I can write
posts in a disconnected environment using Vim, version control them with Git,
and then push them to my server when they&#8217;re finished. I have a nice
deployment setup where everything is stored in a Git repository on the server
and a post-commit hook copies the updated content to the web root for the blog
subdomain. All I have to do is <code>git push</code> and the blog is instantly updated.</li>
<li>Since Wordpress uses hand-written SQL queries, it is tightly coupled with
MySQL and doesn&#8217;t support any other database. PHP is similarly tied to Apache;
while it&#8217;s possible to run it with other servers, it&#8217;s not particularly easy.
By ditching Wordpress, I can also get rid of Apache, PHP and MySQL. This is
nice since I was planning to use nginx and Postgres for my
<a href="/entry/2012/09/14/social-networks-and-content-ownership/">photo album project</a>
anyway.</li>
</ul>


<p>Those are, give or take a few minor considerations, my reasons for switching
blogging platforms. I&#8217;d be remiss to not mention that Octopress does have some
noteworthy disadvantages even for &#8220;power users&#8221; to whom the above advantages
might sound attractive.
<a href="http://alblue.bandlem.com/2012/02/disadvantages-of-octopress.html" title="Disadvantages of Octopress - AlBlue's Blog">This post</a>
does a good job cataloguing a few of them. On the balance, though, I feel like
it&#8217;s a good choice for me, and although the switch took me considerably longer
than I expected (the better part of an weekend where I&#8217;d expected an evening or
so of work), I&#8217;m pretty happy that I did it.</p>

<p>In an upcoming post, I&#8217;ll discuss the actual process of reconfiguring my server
and importing all of my content (which is what I had planned to do before this
turned into a 1,600 word diatribe against Wordpress.) For now, if I&#8217;ve inspired
you and you&#8217;re thinking about switching your own Wordpress site to Octopress,
you can take a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/mlindgren/wp2octopress"><acronym title="Extract, Transform, Load">ETL</acronym> I wrote</a>
to ease the import process.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <small>Did you know that Markdown was created by John Gruber? Until very
recently, I didn&#8217;t. And here I thought all he did was play apologist for
Apple.</small></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m not usually much enamoured with interview-style programming puzzles because I find that a lot of them are actually more akin to math problems, trivial to implement once you figure out the salient mathematical property. Â I think I have a decent intuition for math, and I certainly took enough math courses in high school and college to give me a solid foundation in the fundamentals of algebra, geometry, statistics, calculus, etc., but I&#8217;m not confident enough in my math skills to be entirely comfortable being judged by my ability to exercise them.<!--more--></p>

<p>There are some programming puzzles I really enjoy, though. Â This evening I happened across one such puzzle, viaÂ <a title="@eevee on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/eevee" target="_blank">Eevee&#8217;s Twitter</a>:Â &#8221;<a title="Reversing the Interview Process - Exodus Intelligence" href="http://blog.exodusintel.com/2012/09/18/reversing-the-interview-process/" target="_blank">implement a strlen() function in C that, when compiled, would not contain any conditional branches</a>.&#8221; Â (The page contains solutions, so don&#8217;t read the orange text if you want to try this yourself.) Â This is exactly the kind of puzzle I like; it&#8217;s fun to think about, reasonably challenging, and requires knowledge of language features combined with creative thinking.</p>

<p>My solution is below, but I&#8217;d recommend that you go give this a try yourself before you read on.</p>

<p>As you can see, the solution is actually very simple, but there are a couple of tricks necessary to make it work.  First of all, you obviously can&#8217;t use a loop to count the characters because a loop requires a conditional jump to either terminate or continue.  You could still use a loop-like construct such as <code>goto</code>, but that only reframes the problem; you still need to make a decision about when to jump out.</p>

<p>So, the problem can basically be reduced to this: how can you make a decision without using a conditional?  Well, you can index into an array of possibilities using some property that you can derive from your input.  In this case, the most important property is that the characters can be grouped into two sets: terminating characters (i.e. <code>'\0'</code>) and non-terminating characters (all others).  On that basis, our array of possibilites can consist of two function pointers, one which continues recursively and the other which terminates.</p>

<p>The only problem remaining is how to group the characters, again without using conditionals.  My first thought here was actually to divide the character by itself, in which case all non-terminating characters would be 1, and the null terminator would be&#8230; oh, a divide-by-zero error. I quickly dismissed that thought and realized that binary not is a simpler way to map the characters.  However, Eevee came up with what I think is <a href="https://gist.github.com/3746130" title="Eevee's solution on Github" target="_blank">a very clever and quite unorthodox solution</a> involving division by handling the <code>SIGFPE</code> generated by the division by zero and using the handler to change an unconditional jump address.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d recommend also checking out the solutions provided in the <a title="Reversing the Interview Process - Exodus Intelligence" href="http://blog.exodusintel.com/2012/09/18/reversing-the-interview-process/" target="_blank">original post</a>; all three of them are a bit more elegant than mine, if perhaps a bit more difficult to understand.  (In particular, the count parameter that I use is superfluous, although I don&#8217;t consider the difference particularly important since it can easily be hidden in my solution using a macro or helper function.)</p>

<p>Since my solution isn&#8217;t significantly different from those presented in the original post, I wanted to go a bit further and take a look at the performance implications of not using conditionals.  Yeah, yeah, premature optimization is the root of all evil and all that&mdash;I&#8217;m just doing this out of curiosity; regardless of the results, I would never go this far out of my way to avoid a conditional jump in a real program, nor would I recommend doing so to anyone else.    I decided to compare my solution above against a naÃ¯ve implementation with a while loop; comparing it against <code>strlen()</code> from <code>string.h</code> would be pretty meaningless because it would be linked against a precompiled library which, for all I know, could be hand-optimized.  So here&#8217;s the code I&#8217;m using instead:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m assigning the result to a volatile int to ensure that even when the code is optimized, the compiler won&#8217;t completely optimize out the function call.  So, first, predictions: anyone who has taken a computer architecture course will tell you that conditional jumps can be very expensive because of the recovery the CPU has to do if the branch is mispredicted.  However, branch predictors typically have very high accuracy, and there&#8217;s also a significant overhead involved in putting the parameters and return address on the stack when a function is called.  Therefore, I predict that in that with no compiler optimization, the while loop will be faster.</p>

<p>&#8230;And, it is.  Running each function in a loop 100,000 times on a 23-character string, the average over five trials was 28,699 Âµsec for the non-conditional version and 9,012 Âµsec for the while loop.  Using a fixed string will cause the branch predictor to have near-perfect accuracy in the while loop version, so there might be a slight difference if I used a large array of strings of randomized lengths, but I doubt it would be significant.</p>

<p>But what if we let the compiler (llvm-gcc in this case) optimize it?  I don&#8217;t know enough about compiler optimization in general or llvm-gcc in particular to predict what will happen here.  The non-conditional <code>strlen()</code> is tail recursive so the compiler will optimize out the extra function calls at <code>-O2</code> and above, but what will be optimized beyond that I really don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>As it turns out, compiling at <code>-O3</code> and running 100,000 times on the same 23-character string, the non-conditional function took an average of 11,182 Âµsec over five trials.  That&#8217;s a significant improvement, but it&#8217;s still slower than the unoptimized while loop, so it obviously won&#8217;t beat that.  And indeed, the optimized while loop takes only 3,072 Âµsec.</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;m <a title="Social networks and content ownership - mlindgren.ca" href="http://mlindgren.ca/blog/archives/597" target="_blank">working on a photo album app written in Python.</a>Â  I&#8217;m using Python because, well, I love it. Â I think it&#8217;s the perfect language for web development; it&#8217;s simple and very readable, and ample syntactic sugar and just the right mix of procedural and functional features almost completely eliminate tedious boilerplate. Â As a trivial example for those who have never used Python, consider:<!--more--></p>

<p>What I&#8217;m doing here is grabbing all of the EXIF tags I know about out of my database with <a title="SQLAlchemy" href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/" target="_blank">SQLAlchemy</a>Â (also awesome, by the way), and creating a dictionary which maps each tag&#8217;s name to the corresponding <acronym title="Object-Relational Mapper">ORM</acronym> object; I can find the ORM object simply with <code>db_tags[tag_name]</code>, which lets me easily and efficiently insert new tag values as I read <acronym title="Exchangeable Image File Format">EXIF</acronym> data from a photo. Â This isn&#8217;t particularlyÂ <em>difficult</em> to do in any other language; as I said, it&#8217;s a trivial example. Â But consider how much more verbose the code would be: PHP, which is still the most popular language for web applications despite being an <a title="PHP: A Fractal of Bad Design - Fuzzy Notepad" href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/" target="_blank">incorrigible pile of garbage</a>, doesn&#8217;t have list comprehensions. Â I don&#8217;t even want to think about how many lines of code this would take in Java; additionally, while I&#8217;m unfamiliar with them in general, I suspect Java ORMs require the use of generics to a painful extent (i.e. more than not at all). Â In Python it only takes one <acronym title="Source Line Of Code">SLOC</acronym>, without sacrificing any readability.<sup>1, 2</sup></p>

<p>So, Python&#8217;s pretty great. But like all languages, it does have a few problems. The one I have had the most difficulty with in my current project is that third party library support is somewhat lacking in some important areas; specifically, there aren&#8217;t many good options for reading and manipulating images. The most popular library seems to be the <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">Python Imaging Library</a>, PIL. It&#8217;s easy enough to install and provides aÂ <em>passable</em> set of core features, but doesn&#8217;t go much beyond that. Â For instance, none of the various camera raw formats seem to be supported, which I consider a fairly important feature for my photo album; I&#8217;d very much like be able to upload original raws and have the application automatically convert them to JPEGs for me. Â Additionally, it doesn&#8217;t provide much in the way of convenience methods for cropping and resizing images. Â <a title="ImageMagick" href="http://www.imagemagick.org/" target="_blank">ImageMagick</a> has <a title="ImageMagick geometry" href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php#geometry" target="_blank">a very nice means of specifying cropping and resizing geometry</a> with various aspect ratio-preserving (or not) behaviour, and I wanted to be able to leverage something similar for my app so that I could quickly prototype with various size options.</p>

<p>Given that ImageMagick provides most of the functionality I want that PIL lacks, it seemed like a good option, but it&#8217;s a C library and Python doesn&#8217;t yet have mature bindings for it. Â It&#8217;s getting there, though! Â I decided to go with <a title="Python Wand library" href="http://dahlia.kr/wand/index.html" target="_blank">Wand</a>, which is a fork of python-magickwand. Â It has a nice high-level API, but also provides direct access to most of the low-level MagickWand APIs, making it fairly flexible. Â When I first found it, it did not have support for the nice geometry specifications I wanted to use, but being an open source project I was able to patch that in. Â <a title="Wand version 0.2.2" href="http://dahlia.kr/wand/changes.html#version-0-2-2" target="_blank">Version 0.2.2</a> will include my patch, which provides the <code>Image.transform</code> method for easy cropping and resizing. Â Eevee is also <a title="Sanpera - Eevee's Github" href="https://github.com/eevee/sanpera" target="_blank">working on a Python imaging library</a>, which is promising, but it&#8217;s still a work in progress.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Wand doesn&#8217;t yet support retrieving EXIF, <acronym title="International Press Telecommunications Council">IPTC</acronym> or <acronym title="Extensible Metadata Platform">XMP</acronym> metadata from images, which is another requirement for me. Â ImageMagick does support EXIF at least, and that&#8217;s on the roadmap for Wand, but implementing a high-level interface for EXIF tags is a bigger task than I have time for at the moment. Â That meant that I had to turn to another library to retrieve metadata. Â <a title="pyexiv2 library" href="http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/" target="_blank">pyexiv2</a>, a Python binding for the exiv2 C++ library, initially looked promising. Â Unfortunately I discovered that it&#8217;s not installable via any Python package manager; it must be built from source (via a build system I&#8217;ve never even heard of, and I&#8217;m familiar with more than a few build systems), unless a binary is provided for your platform by the project maintainers (i.e. you are on Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora or Windows).</p>

<p>My project already has more dependencies than I&#8217;m entirely comfortable with; one of the reasons that Python only has modest adoption as a web application platform despite being a great language for the task is that it doesn&#8217;t have a kitchen sink-style standard library, and third-party libraries require separate installation. Â In general I consider that a good thing; I&#8217;d rather have a well-designed standard library than a <a title="PHP: A Fractal of Bad Design - Fuzzy Notepad" href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/#general" target="_blank">gigantic mishmash of inconsistently named global functions.</a>Â  However, it does make deployment a little more complex. Â So far I&#8217;ve managed to stick to libraries which can be installed in one step using well-known package managers, so the setup procedure for my app should not be too arduous. Â Adding pyexiv2 as a dependency and thereby including an entirely different build system in the process would likely have complicated the installation procedure to the point that no actual ordinary humans would ever use my application. Â That&#8217;s something I want to avoid, if possible.</p>

<p><del>For now I have settled for exif-py.</del>Â  It only handles EXIF tags, not IPTC or XMP, which is disappointing because I really wanted to support multiple metadata formats. Â It&#8217;s a pure Python library in a single file, though, so I can just include with my distribution. Â It&#8217;s easy to use and gets the job done, so it will have to do for now. Â I&#8217;m hoping that pyexiv2 will show up in pip (a Python package manager) at some point, though. Â [<strong>Updated September 16, 2012:Â </strong>I&#8217;ve discovered that exif-py is broken in at least a couple significant ways, so I&#8217;m kind of back at square one for handling metadata. Â exif-py seems to be unable to detect EXIF data in some files that have it. Â Additionally, the strings that it translates orientation codes to are not consistent with each other, so they&#8217;re basically wrong. Â I&#8217;ve informed the maintainers of these issues, but I don&#8217;t have time to fix them myself.]</p>

<p>The process of trying to find a good imaging package for Python and ultimately settling for two separate libraries which still don&#8217;t quite do everything I want has made it clear to me that third party library support for Python still has a way to go. Â Hopefully the situation will improve as adoption of the language increases. Â I&#8217;m happy to do my part, both through contributions to open source libraries such as Wand, and by building apps using Python to bolster the ecosystem. Â I hope that by demonstrating what&#8217;s possible with Python as a web application platform, I can help convince new web developers to build their applications using Python as well&#8230; which provides yet more reason for me to be diligent about finishing my photo album app!</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <small>Okay, the <code>dict</code> function is perhaps not the most explicit. Check the docs once, though, and it&#8217;s very easy to understand.</small><br/>
<sup>2</sup> <small>Ruby would doubtless be similarly concise, and it seems like a nice language in my limited experience, but I find its syntax and distinction between &#8220;symbols&#8221; and strings to not be to my taste.</small></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m always wary about pre-announcing things I&#8217;m working on; I have more ambition than spare time, which leads to a tendency to start projects and not finish them. Â But if there&#8217;s to be a point in maintaining this website, I need to actuallyÂ <em>write things</em> once in a while, so I may as well write about what I&#8217;ve been hacking on lately. Â At the moment, I&#8217;m building a web-based photo album in Python. Â My primary reason for doing this is that I&#8217;d like to own more of my information. Â Apps and social networks have some significant advantages, particularly for the less technologically inclined, but I&#8217;m ambivalent about the trend away from an open Internet and towards a set of non-interoperable, monolithic walled-garden services.<!--more--></p>

<p>When Google+ debuted, my enthusiasm for the service followed a sort of bell curve. Â I was already using Twitter and Facebook, and I didn&#8217;t want to have to post everything to yet another service. Â At the urging of friends, I joined anyway, and warmed to it considerably. Â It was simply better software than Facebook; the interface was cleaner, the privacy controls more usable, the communication options more diverse, the means of sharing and interacting with media more engaging and deeply integrated. Â Best of all, there wasn&#8217;t nearly as much app spam. Â Much of this is probably still true, although the impression I get from Google+ pages I&#8217;ve stumbled across recently is that they&#8217;ve been trying to make it look more like Facebook, to its detriment.</p>

<p>Realizing that it was a better product in almost every regard, I started using Google+ almost exclusively and tried to recruit additional friends away from Facebook. Â I stopped uploading new photos to Facebook and even purchased additional storage capacity on Google+ so I could upload all of my photos there at the original quality. Â Problems quickly became apparent, though. Â Despite my best efforts, nobody was using the service; even among those of my friends who were enthusiastic early adopters, actualÂ <em>social</em> activity among my circles dropped off quickly, and I soon found myself wondering why I even bothered to check for updates. Â I finally deleted my account when I logged in one day and realized that the newest post in my news feed was from several months prior.</p>

<p>And with my Google+ account, there went all of the photos and other content I had uploaded. Â I still have the files, of course, but the effort I expended in selecting a handful of good photos to upload to each gallery from the hundreds of shots I take on most outings, not to mention the comments, captions, and other metadata I had curated, vanished into the ether with not a trace left behind. Â The moral of the story is that private social networks are impermanent, and thus anything uploaded to them necessarily has an unknown but very much finite period of accessibility and relevance. Â Whether or not Google ever admits it, Google+ never quite took off, but it could have supplanted Facebook just as Facebook did MySpace. Â If and when some other service comes along and succeeds where Google+ failed, every user on Facebook will be forced to start over from scratch on whatever&#8217;s in vogue next.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m tired of playing that game. I want to keep control over the content I create so that I can truly decide how it&#8217;s shared and with whom, and so that if I need to migrate my data to a new system, I have the means to do so.<sup>1</sup> The ultimate realization of this ideal is in decentralized services based on open protocols, such as <a title="Tent" href="http://tent.io/">Tent</a>. I&#8217;m very enthusiastic about such attempts, but realistically, I&#8217;m skeptical that any of them will ever gain the necessary traction to make a real difference. Even if Tent or some analogue gains millions of users, it will be a drop in the bucket compared to Facebook, and entrenched players such as Facebook will have no incentive to interoperate because decentralized services do nothing but threaten their business model.</p>

<p>I will do as much as is in my power to help services like Tent succeed, but for the time being, that is not much. Â That kind of leaves me without a good means of pushing my content to the people who care about it. Â Nevertheless, I can still take ownership of it by hosting it on my own server using my own tools. Â That is the purpose of developing my own photo album software. Â I&#8217;m making good progress so far, and hopefully soon I&#8217;ll have more to share; once the code is in a reasonably complete state with most of the major features I want for my own purposes, I intend to make the app open source and share the code on my <a title="mlindgren on Github" href="https://github.com/mlindgren" target="_blank">Github account.</a>Â  And now that I&#8217;ve announced my intent publicly, I expect anyone who reads this to hold me to my plan to ensure that I get it finished!</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <small>Both Facebook and Google+ provide a means of exporting the data you&#8217;ve shared. I believe both will export everything belonging to you personally, but I don&#8217;t think you necessarily get to keep all of the social data associated with your content, e.g. comments, nor the relationships between different pieces of content. Last I checked, the data was merely dumped into a bunch of flat files; nothing is kept in a structured format that makes it easy to work with, and even if it were, other privates services don&#8217;t usually offer the option to import your data. While it may still not be easy, if you own your own data and manage it using open source tools, it&#8217;s at least <em>possible</em> to migrate everything to another system with the greatest fidelity supported by that system.</small></p>
