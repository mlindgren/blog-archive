In October of 2011, Walter Isaacson released his <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs_(book)">biography of Steve Jobs</a>, which quickly
became the Amazon's best-selling book of the year despite its late release. The success was
well-deserved; Isaacson has proven himself time and again to be an excellent biographer, and with
_Steve Jobs_ he made a riveting story out of the life of one of the tech industry's most lauded (but
also most divisive) figures&mdash;all while maintaining a balanced and neutral perspective.

But as great a read as _Steve Jobs_ was, and as influential as Steve Jobs the man was, there's a
limit to the extent of what one person working alone can accomplish. This was true of Jobs&mdash;his
grand designs could only have been realized with the help of talented individuals such as Steve
Wozniak and later Jony Ive&mdash;and, as Isaacson shows in _The Innovators_, it has been equally
true of other visionaries throughout the history of computing. _The Innovators_, therefore, is
Isaacson's effort to "step away from doing biographies, which tend to emphasize the role of singular
individuals," and to instead take a broader view, in this case of the history of computing, by
highlighting the contributions of _teams_ of talented individuals working towards common goals.

Another major theme which runs throughout _The Innovators_ is the intersection of the arts and
sciences. Isaacson writes that "the truest creativity of the digital age came from those who were
able to connect [the two]. [...] The people who were comfortable at this humanities-technology
intersection helped to create the human-machine symbiosis that is at the core of this story."

Isaacson begins in the early to mid ninteenth century with the collaboration between Ada Byron,
Countess of Lovelace (also known as Ada Lovelace, and daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron), and
Charles Babbage. Babbage designed the
[Difference Engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine), an early mechanical calculator,
and the [Analytical Engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine). Although neither of
these were actually constructed during Babbage's lifetime (the Analytical Engine still only exists
as a design), they were pioneering for their time&mdash;especially the Analytical Engine, which was
the world's first design for a general-purpose,
[Turing-complete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) computer. Lady Lovelace, working
alongside Babbage, became the world's first computer programmer, producing a series of notes on the
Analtyical Engine which included examples of algorithms it would be able to carry out.
