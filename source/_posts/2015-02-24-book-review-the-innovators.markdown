In October of 2011, Walter Isaacson released his
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs_(book)">biography of Steve Jobs</a>,
which quickly became the Amazon's best-selling book of the year despite its late
release. The success was well-deserved; Isaacson has proven himself time and
again to be an excellent biographer, and with _Steve Jobs_ he made a riveting
story out of the life of one of the tech industry's most lauded (but also most
divisive) figures&mdash;all while maintaining a balanced and neutral
perspective.

But as great as _Steve Jobs_ was, and as transformative as Steve Jobs the man
was, there's a limit to the extent of what one person working alone can
accomplish. This was true of Steve Jobs&mdash;his grand designs could only have
been realized with the help of talented individuals such as Steve Wozniak and
later Jony Ive&mdash;and, as Isaacson shows in _The Innovators_, it has been
equally true of other visionaries throughout the history of computing. _The
Innovators_, therefore, is Isaacson's effort to "step away from doing
biographies, which tend to emphasize the role of singular individuals," and to
instead take a broader view, in this case of the history of computing, by
highlighting the contributions of _teams_ of talented individuals working
towards common goals.
