    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>David Somers presents an
<a href="http://labs.newsint.co.uk/blog/2012/10/why-mozilla-persona-is-the-right-answer-to-the-question-of-identity/">excellent rundown</a>
of what
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/">Mozilla Persona</a> is and why it&rsquo;s
currently the best option for identity and authentication for web services. I&rsquo;ve
implemented authentication using Persona in the
<a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2012/09/14/social-networks-and-content-ownership/">photo album app</a>
I&rsquo;m working on, and I found it remarkably easy to integrate with my app. And, as
David explains, Persona is also much easier for users to understand than
competing platforms like OpenID. If you&rsquo;re a web developer, you really need to
add Persona support to your application as soon as
possible. It can be done in literally a matter of minutes, and if Persona takes
off the benefit to identity management on the Internet could be huge.</p>

<p>Perhaps my favourite thing about Persona is that it gives me the opportunity to
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Persona/Implementing_a_Persona_IdP">implement my own identity provider</a>,
which means I can have <em>complete</em> control over how I authenticate to any
Persona-consuming service. I could have <em>n</em>-factor authentication, with no limit
on the complexity or specificity of the factors besides my own imagination. For
example, I could generate SSL client certificates for each of my machines and
hardcode their thumbprints into my identity provider to ensure that it wouldn&rsquo;t
even service requests from machines I haven&rsquo;t explicitly added.  Or if I wanted
to get creative, I could have my identity provider generate a random temporary
key which I would have to retrieve via SSH (but this is less convenient and
probably also less secure than doing SSL client authentication.) The
possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>Perhaps an end is finally in sight to the frustration of having dozens upon
dozens of different accounts and passwords for various services,
<a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2011/12/04/fuck-passwords/">each with its own uniquely nonsensical password composition policy</a>.  Everyone needs to implement Persona&mdash;preferably yesterday.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2011/12/30/ethical-game-design-from-gamasutra/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-30T16:28:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2011/12/30/ethical-game-design-from-gamasutra</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I came across a couple excellent articles on Gamasutra which I want to share here. The first, &ldquo;<a title="Contrivance and Extortion: In-App Purchases &amp; Microtransactions" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AdamSaltsman/20111018/8685/Contrivance_and_Extortion_InApp_Purchases__Microtransactions.php">Contrivance and Extortion: In-App Purchases &amp; Microtransactions</a>&rdquo; is by <a href="http://adamatomic.com/" target="_blank">Adam Saltsman</a>, creator of Canabalt, among other games. He argues that in-app purchases and so-called microtransactions are being abused by some game developers, &ldquo;deliberately contriving their designs in the worst way in order to extort money from players, which is unethical and unacceptable design practice.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll lay my cards on the table and say that I am in complete agreement with Adam.  As he does in his <a title="Contrivance and Extortion II: Clarifications, Feedback &amp; Suggestions" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AdamSaltsman/20111020/8703/Contrivance_and_Extortion_II_Clarifications_Feedback__Suggestions.php">explanatory follow-up</a>, I acknowledge that there are benefits to the &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; model, but the techniques commonly associated with that model are often used in a cynical, manipulative and profit-driven manner which I feel is harmful to consumers and the industry. Whether or not you agree, Adam&rsquo;s thoughts on the subject are certainly worth reading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<a title="Radical Plagiarism: The Ethical Lessons of the Gamenauts Controversy" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/EvanJones/20110815/8195/Radical_Plagiarism_The_Ethical_Lessons_of_the_Gamenauts_Controversy.php" target="_blank">Radical Plagiarism: The Ethical Lessons of the Gamenauts Controversy</a>,&rdquo; by <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/author/EvanJones/4235/">Evan Jones</a>, is equally thought-provoking. Evan recounts the cloning of the indie game <a href="http://www.bored.com/game/play/150995/Radical_Fishing.html"><em>Radical Fishing</em></a> by the more established indie studio <a href="http://gamenauts.com/">Gamenauts</a>, and adds his perspective on the cultural impact of the rampant cloning that takes place on mobile app stores. Returning readers may recall that I&rsquo;ve previously <a title="In Defense of Clones" href="http://www.mlindgren.ca/archives/318">defended the practice of cloning games</a>. My defense excluded the cloning of smaller titles by established studios, which I&rsquo;ve always viewed as morally questionable at best, but Evan&rsquo;s article nevertheless gave me pause. He provides a strong counterpoint to my own thinking on the matter, and while I&rsquo;m not yet ready to reverse my position, his argument has undeniable weight. If you&rsquo;re at all interested in game development, both articles are well worth your time.</p>

    <id>http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2011/02/03/non-myths-about-programming</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whilst browsing <a href="http://reddit.com" target="_blank">Reddit</a> today, I came across a short essay by <a href="http://stwww.weizmann.ac.il/g-cs/benari/" target="_blank">Mordechai Ben-Ari</a> titled &ldquo;<a title="PDF: Non-Myths About Programming" href="http://stwww.weizmann.ac.il/G-CS/BENARI/articles/nonmyths.pdf" target="_blank">Non-Myths About Programming</a>&rdquo; (PDF warning).  It&rsquo;s only six pages long, and I found it refreshingly realistic and insightful.  I would urge anyone considering a career in computer science to read it.  Given its brevity (and the fact the title is reasonably descriptive), I won&rsquo;t bother summarizing the article—instead, I&rsquo;ll merely say that you should click the link and check it out for yourself.</p>
