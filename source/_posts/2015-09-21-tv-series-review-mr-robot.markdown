I don't watch a whole lot of TV. In fact, I don't even have cable. The only
shows I end up watching, therefore, are those I'm introduced to or I read about.
_Mr. Robot_ is the latest such show; I read
[David Auerbach's piece on it](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2015/06/mr_robot_on_usa_finally_hollywood_created_a_realistic_hacker_character.html)
and was intrigued. In Auerbach's words:

> Real misfits&mdash;disturbing, unappealing, unlovable misfits&mdash;make for
> poor Hollywood protagonists. It takes some faith to inject a genuinely
> alienating hero into a film or TV show. But ever since the broader world of

This is probably a polarizing description: some people will be immediately
interested while others will probably question why anyone would want to watch
it. It was very much the former for me, possibly because Auerbach's description
of Elliot hits a bit close to home. I watched the first episode and was
instantly hooked. The show immediately draws you into its world: a sort of
dystopian present, a mirror image of our own reality, but viewed through the
eyes of a brilliant, cynical, emotionally troubled young man who struggles not
only with an unfeeling universe but also with drug addiction and mental
illness.

Atypically for movies and TV, Elliot's mental illness is depicted  respectfully
and at least somewhat accurately, too. He's not an over-the-top Hollywood
psycho, but merely a vulnerable person suffering from paranoia and delusions.
And being a software developer, I also really appreciated that the show nails
the technology.  It's not _completely_ realistic, but that's to be expected; the
reality of programming and hacking is that they're slow, analytical processes,
often consisting of long stretches of thought punctuated by short bursts of
activity.  In other words, they're boring to watch, and sometimes to undertake,
too.  _Mr. Robot_ strips that away, but it keeps the interesting aspects intact
without insulting the audience's intelligence with impossible technology,
meaningless invented jargon, or awful 3D <acronym title="Graphical User
Interface">GUI</acronym>s.

The overarching social commentary in _Mr. Robot_ is also captivating. It's not
especially original, nor remarkably insightful, but it's executed marvelously;
because everything is presented from Elliot's point of view, it's very hard not
to take an empathetic attitude to his perception. This is also true of the mood
of specific scenes: the intimacy between the viewer and Elliot is an extremely
effective tool for creating suspense, or sadness, or whatever else the show
wants you to feel, because you're so invested in him.

It helps that the show's production quality is excellent as well. The
cinematography is excellent, the music is superb and perfectly matched to each
scene, and the acting is stellar&mdash;not only from star Rami Malek, but also
from his co-stars, who include Christian Slater, Portia Doubleday, Carly
Chaikin, and others. Not all of them have the name recognition of Slater, but
every one is excellent in his or her role, which is far more important.
(Besides, it's nice to see some new faces.)

But unfortunately, it's not all good news. The first seven or so episodes of the
series are all-around excellent, but after that... well, first a warning: **major
spoilers** begin below here. Scroll down to continue reading.

...after that, shit gets crazy. Literally.

From the beginning of the series, Elliot is clearly an unreliable narrator.  The
presentation of the show is not "objective" in the sense that we see the
majority of it through the filter of Elliot's biases, but beyond that, the
extent of his mental illness isn't really clear. Is he just socially anxious and
a bit paranoi,d or is he actually suffering from hallucinations? What else is he
hiding from us? Up through episode seven, we don't really know.

But then, in episode eight, Elliot has a complete psychotic break. It is
revealed that Mr. Robot never actually existed, at least not as we know him.
Rather, he is a dissociated personality of Elliot's, and not only that, his
appearance and behavior are projected from repressed memories of Elliot's dead
father. I'm not a psychologist, but this is implausible to me to the extent that
it makes suspension of disbelief becomes very difficult.

I wrote above that the show's portrayal of Elliot's mental illness was
respectful and realistic in contrast to what Hollywood typically does. That was
what I thought until episode eight. Post-episode eight, Elliot is the
_archetype_ of ridiculous Hollywood insanity. His dissociative identity disorder
is straight out of _Fight Club_ (and so, for that matter, are certain elements
of _Mr. Robot_'s plot); I'm not sure how many times that specific trope has been
used, but it already feels tired and overdone.

There's a scene in episode ten where Elliot gets in a fight with Mr. Robot, and
the camera cuts between what he's hallucinating and what's really happening; in
the latter, we see him choking himself up against a wall while people look on in
shock and confusion. The scene is just ridiculous&mdash;I honestly wasn't sure
whether it was supposed to be sad, or dramatic, or comical.

To be fair, although I wasn't impressed with the over-the-top portrayl of
Elliot's hallucinations, the show does a good job of making it plausible that
Mr. Robot never actually existed separately from Elliot. If you watch closely,
you notice that other characters never address Elliot and Mr. Robot at the same
time, and when the two of them are talking, nobody else ever takes notice. (Some
viewers caught on to this from the beginning and thus saw the twist coming. I
didn't, so I had to go back and double-check.) And although the ability that
Elliot apparently develops to summon Mr. Robot at will is also absurd, I'm glad
that Slater's character won't be disappearing. He does an excellent job in the
role, and he's a big part of what makes the show so as good as it is.

Some scenes, though, require serious mental gymnastics once we realize that Mr.
Robot isn't real. For instance, one wonders why Darlene was so slow to recognize
Elliot's psychosis given how differently he must have been acting from day to
day. And then there are the scenes in episode five, in which Mr. Robot, Romero,
and Mobley all talk to Elliot via radio as he infiltrates Steel Mountain.  They
don't all talk at once, and the other two don't directly acknowledge Mr.
Robot's presence, so presumably we're to believe that Elliot is also just
imagining Mr. Robot talking to him in this case. But this feels like a cop out.
If almost everything we're being shown is just Elliot's wild
hallucinations&mdash;even when Elliot isn't in the scene and cannot possibly
know what is occuring&mdash;it feels like the rug has been pulled out from under
us and there's no basis on which to trust the authenticity of _anything_. That
makes the entire plot feel hollow.

As much as I was disappointed by the direction _Mr. Robot_ took towards the end
of the first season, it's still a very good show. All of the positive things I
wrote before the cut still apply. And, critically, it's managing to advance the
plot while maintaing suspense. I never watched _Lost_, but from everything I've
heard it eventually became a disastrous mess of questions piled upon questions,
all unanswered, ultimately leaving viewers feeling as if they'd been jerked
around by writers who were flying by the seats of their pants. _Mr. Robot_
doesn't do that. The destruction of Evil Corp's records that the whole season
was building up to did happen, and in the next season we'll see the
reprecussions of that.  But there are still many other threads waiting to be
explored&mdash;will we see more of Fernando Vera? What is Evil Corp's motive in
hiring Angela? What happened to Wellick? Why does Whiterose know Price?

I'm looking forward to season two. I just hope it's a bit more
grounded&mdash;more like the early episodes of season one than the latter half.
I'm worried about whether or not Sam Esmail can pull that off given bizarre
history he now has to accomodate, but I enjoyed the show enough that I'll give
him the benefit of the doubt. If nothing else, the first few episodes of _Mr.
Robot_ will always stand out to me as an instant classic.

_And_ we've finally got a successful TV show written by someone who understands
computers as more than voodoo boxes capable of literal magic if you can type
gibberish fast enough (perhaps by enlisting another pair of hands on the same
keyboard). I'll take my victories where I can get them.
