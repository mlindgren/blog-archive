Originally published as a
["Kindle single"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindle_single) in 2011, Sam
Harris' _[Lying](http://www.samharris.org/lying)_ was republished in a revised
and expanded format in 2013, but it remains more of an essay than a book. The
entirety of the book weighs in at 108 pages, but the main content takes up only
about a third of that. The remaining two thirds consist of a transcript of a
conversation between Harris and professor Ronald A. Howard, whom Harris credits
as the inspiration for the book, and an FAQ based on feedback received since the
original publication. These latter two parts make a worthwhile addendum to the
original essay, but they are by no means indispensable: the centerpiece here is
Harris' analysis of the act of lying and all the ways in which it can lead to
bad outcomes.

In _Lying_, Harris attempts to make the case that dishonesty is almost always
unethical, and that simply by being truthful, one can avoid "endless forms of
suffering and embarrassment." This might seem like a fairly obvious statement,
but Harris explicitly includes (and, in fact, primarily focuses on) "white
lies"&mdash;those small lies we tell not for our own benefit, but, we think, to
spare others from hurt feelings or unpalatable truths. Though white lies are
often told by good people for what they believe to be are good reasons, Harris
argues that the cost of these lies, in the long term, outweighs their benefit:

Harris provides a number of examples of how white lies can backfire: by
dishonestly telling a friend that he doesn't need to lose weight, you might be
denying him the motivation he needs to live a healthier lifestyle. By hiding a
serious medical diagnosis from loved ones, you foreshorten their opportunity to
come to terms with it, and miss a chance to deepen your relationship. By
providing false encouragement about a friend's career prospects, you lead her to
waste time and energy that might be spent more productively with a change of
course.

Although he does make a case for honesty in situations in which many of us would
be tempted to lie, Harris does not seem to be advocating for
["Radical Honesty"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Honesty). Radical
Honesty, [as I understand it](http://www.esquire.com/features/honesty0707),
requires not only complete honesty, but also complete _transparency_, and what
some might call a stunning lack of tact. Harris, by contrast, allows that it may
sometimes be necessary to "[hold] one's tongue, or [steer] a conversation toward
topics of relative safety" in order to maintain civility. He also sees no
conflict in principle between being honest and keeping secrets: "If someone asks
how much money you have in your bank account, you are under no ethical
obligation to tell him. The truth could well be 'I'd rather not say.'"

Harris' position is certainly easier to embrace than "Radical Honesty," which I
imagine could easily ruin your life if you don't have _extremely_ understanding
friends and family. That said, it's still not easy, in practice, to always be
honest. It is hard to tell people things that you know they won't want to hear.
It takes willpower and emotional energy to always make the virtuous choice
rather than looking for the easy way out. And there are edge cases, rare but by
no means impossible, where the ethical value of honesty really does seem
questionable. For instance, consider this example from Harris' conversation with
professor Howard:

> **Harris:** ... Other examples of this [ethical difficulty] have come to me from
> people who are caring for parents with dementia. Your mother wakes up every
> morning wondering where your father is, but your father has been dead for
> fifteen years. Every time you explain this, your mother has to relive the
> bereavement process all over again, only to wake up the next morning looking
> for her husband. Let's assume that when you lie, saying something like "Oh,
> he's away on a business trip," your mother very quickly forgets about your
> father's absence and her grief doesn't get reactivated.
>
> **Howard:** That's an interesting one. I would be tempted to say something like
> "Well, he's where he usually is at this time of day." The fact that he's
> buried in the ground somewhere doesn't add anything to this person's knowledge
> of what's going on. And as you pointed out, you would just be putting her
> through pain all over again. As you stated the case, why would you want to do
> that?

This answer doesn't seem entirely satisfactory. First of all, what if you were
asked for a more specific answer than the one Howard gave? In that case, I think
you really would be forced to lie, and from a consequentialist point of view
that really does seem like the right thing to do given the situation; Howard
almost admits as much. And even if that's not the case, Howard's answer still
seems deliberately designed to be deceptive, even if it is not strictly false.
He goes on to call this "'skillful truth-telling' as opposed to 'evasion,'" but
that seems like a euphemism to me.

This exemplifies the problem I have with _Lying_. I'm in complete agreement with
Harris that lying is almost never the right choice, for both ethical and
practical reasons. But believing that in principle is much different from
adhering to it in practice. How does we resist the almost reflexive impulse to
tell people only what we think they want to hear? Where do we draw the line
between reasonably concealing of private information and dishonestly withholding
facts that people have a right to know? And how can we train ourselves to
reliably decide when situations really do warrant "skillful truth-telling" if
not outright deception? These questions are not always easy to answer, and I
don't think that _Lying_ does enough to address them.

If you find yourself to really be in need of convincing that white lies can be
harmful and should generally not be ethically permissible, then _Lying_ is
probably a worthwhile read. But if you already accept that proposition, this
book is hard to recommend.
