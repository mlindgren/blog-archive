  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t discuss politics on this site, but today warrants an exception. Canada has suffered a terrible loss with the death of Jack Layton, the leader of the federal New Democratic Party. He was an inspiring figure, hopeful and optimistic right to the end, and he devoted his life to the betterment of Canada and its citizens. He was taken from us far too soon, and will be sorely missed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With the phenomenal and growing successes of the iPhone App Store, the Android Market, and the Xbox Live Indie Games marketplace, gamers have seen an unprecedented number of titles which could be described as &#8220;clones&#8221; of more successful games&mdash;or rip-offs, if you&#8217;re feeling less kind.  Along with these titles has come a veritable tsunami of hatred for their developers, from game critics and anonymous Internet commenters alike.  The commercial success of some of these titles, such as <em>Angry Birds</em>,<sup>1</sup> has shown that average gamers are happy to patronize any developer who can provide a fun experience, regardless of originality.  However, any mention of a new clone on a gaming blog or podcast inevitably brings about a stunning amount of vitriol from gamers who, presumably, are upset that their favorite megacorporations aren&#8217;t getting their due.<!--more--></p>




<p>I don&#8217;t understand this, but my best guess it that it stems from a misunderstanding of the motivations of game developers, and of the development process itself.  I hope that by illuminating those things I can do something to stem the tide of rage and indignation.  First, though, I&#8217;d like to briefly discuss the legality of game clones.  The patentability and copyrightability of game mechanics and &#8220;look and feel&#8221; varies from country to country.  Notably, the <a href="http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2010/e/ar52.html" target="_blank" title="European Patent Convention, Article 52">European Patent Convention explicitly states</a> that &#8220;schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, and programs for computers&#8221; are not patentable, whereas no such restriction exists in the United States.  There are <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2315/its_just_a_game_right_top_.php" target="_blank" title="Gamasutra: It's Just a Game, Right? Top Mythconceptions on Patent Protection of Video Games">several notable examples</a> of game-related patents in the United States, but the industry is young and there are relatively few legal precedents on their enforceability.  I am not a lawyer, so it would be unwise of me to assert too much here, but I will state that throwing around terms like &#8220;copyright infringement&#8221; is neither productive nor terribly meaningful when discussing game clones.</p>




<p>I&#8217;d also like to make clear that by &#8220;clone,&#8221; I mean a legitimately developed game with similar gameplay mechanics and/or art style to an established title.  I am emphatically <em>not</em> referring to situations in which actual code or art assets have been used without permission; under no circumstances do I condone actual copyright infringement.  Finally, in the interest of full disclosure, I should also inform you that I have a dog in this race, so to speak: my game, <em><a href="http://www.mlindgren.ca/projects/puzzle-panel">Puzzle Panel</a></em>, borrows gameplay mechanics from <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_Attack" target="_blank">Tetris Attack</a></em> and takes artistic cues from <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft" target="_blank">World of Warcraft</a></em>.</p>

<p><em>Tobar</em> for iOS is a recent example of the kinds of titles I&#8217;m talking about.  The game is a fairly obvious mimicry of <em><a href="http://supermeatboy.com" target="_blank">Super Meat Boy</a></em>, and while <em>Meat Boy</em> co-creator Edmund McMillian is relatively unperturbed by it, many of his fans are less forgiving.  I&#8217;m going to pick on the <a href="http://destructoid.com">Destructoid</a> community here for no other reason than that Destructoid is one of my favorite gaming publications, but a quick Google search reveals no shortage of hatred for <em>Tobar</em>.<sup>2</sup>  <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/meat-boy-dev-has-mixed-feelings-about-ios-knock-offs-205886.phtml#comment" target="_blank" title="Meat Boy dev has mixed feelings about iOS knock-offs - Destructoid">Destructoid user Noir Trilby writes</a>:</p>




<p><blockquote>What a shameless rip off. It&#8217;s good that Ed is cool about it and all, but if I was him I&#8217;d be raging. Both Apple and Android need someone doing some quality control on their aming services to screen out blatant rip offs like this.</blockquote></p>




<p>Even associate editor Jonathan Holmes goes so far as to say that the game &#8220;makes him frown,&#8221; which&mdash;though it doesn&#8217;t sound it&mdash;is fairly significant criticism coming from a man so kind and gentle as to have probably never said a genuinely hurtful thing is his life.</p>




<p>As I&#8217;ve already mentioned, I don&#8217;t think <em>Tobar</em>, nor other games like it, deserve the hate they receive.  There are a number of reasons why I feel this way.  First, all art is iterative, and video games are no exception.  Creativity is not binary, but is a matter of degree.  Second, when indie developers borrow from established properties, there&#8217;s little evidence that it&#8217;s detrimental to the owners of those properties, whereas it may be extremely beneficial to consumers.  Finally, I feel that there&#8217;s a misconception that games like <em>Tobar</em> exist because lazy, greedy developers want to make a quick buck and can&#8217;t be bothered to do the work to come up with an original title.  That perception is wrong on many levels, which I&#8217;ll discuss in further detail in the following paragraphs.</p>




<p>The apparent trend of smaller developers &#8220;ripping off&#8221; well known games is probably an illusion.  It&#8217;s likely that these are simply the instances of liberal borrowing that we hear about, due to the popularity of the &#8220;borrowee.&#8221;  Take <em>Angry Birds</em>, for example.  Most people would point to it as an example of a successful, original title by a studio that was relatively small at the time of its release.  The truth is that although its art style is unique, its gameplay mechanics are borrowed heavily from an older flash game called <em><a href="http://armorgames.com/play/3614/crush-the-castle" target="_blank">Crush the Castle</a></em>.  Or how about <em>Super Meat Boy</em>?  It surely owes some of its success to predecessors such as <em><a href="http://www.gamemakergames.com/archive/jumper-two" target="_blank">Jumper Two</a></em>, <em><a href="http://kayin.pyoko.org/iwbtg/" target="_blank">I Wanna Be The Guy</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.thewayoftheninja.org/" target="_blank">N+</a></em>.</p>

<p>Granted, each of these games have their own original elements, whereas <em>Tobar</em> at least appears to be a fairly direct attempt at reproducing <em>Super Meat Boy</em>.  But every great game stands on the shoulders of giants, and every developer has to start somewhere.  Games like <em>Tobar</em> should not be condemned as soulless exercises in profiteering, but recognized for what they are: a means for inexperienced developers to hone their skills while contributing to new markets, much as a musician might start out by covering popular songs in venues where the original artist would never perform.</p>




<p>Words like <em>stealing</em> and <em>theft</em> are often thrown around in discussions of game clones.  But one of the defining characteristics of theft is that it deprives the owner of his or her property.  What harm is the existence of <em>Tobar</em> doing to Team Meat?  Given that Team Meat&#8217;s Tommy Refenes has publicly stated that he has &#8220;no intentions on doing anything for iPhone or iPad ever&#8230;I hate the [iPhone and iPad] platforms and I hate the [app] stores,&#8221; <em>Tobar</em> is in no sense a competitor to <em>Super Meat Boy</em>.  I don&#8217;t know the developer of <em>Tobar</em>, but I&#8217;d wager that his intent was simply to bring gameplay he loves to a new platform that he&#8217;s passionate about.</p>




<p>Passion is exactly why I created <em>Puzzle Panel</em>; I wasn&#8217;t looking to make quick money by ripping off someone else&#8217;s creativity and putting it on a new platform.  Rather, I wanted to share a game that I loved with an audience who might have never seen it before, on a platform where it was unlikely to ever see the light of day otherwise.  I am not a veteran game critic who values unique mechanics above all else because he&#8217;s seen most gameplay elements a thousand times before, nor am I a would-be <em>artiste</em> desperately attempting to create a legacy for himself.  For these reasons, I value fun over originality.  If people enjoy my game, that is enough for me.  If a nervous child at the doctor&#8217;s office finds solace in something I&#8217;ve created, my work has paid off immeasurably.  If I can contribute just a little more happiness to someone&#8217;s life, I am satisfied.</p>




<p>&#8220;If the motivations of indie developers are purely in the interest of gamers,&#8221; you might ask, &#8220;why charge money for these clones?&#8221;  Well, the reasons are simple.  First, we&#8217;re human, and we need to eat; it&#8217;s nice to get paid for one&#8217;s work, even when said work is not completely novel.  Second, even discounting the dozens or hundreds of hours of effort required to make the simplest of games, there are significant up-front costs to developers in creating games.  Developer licenses, development software, test hardware, and licensed or commissioned music, sound effects and graphics add up very quickly.</p>




<p>I did all of the programming and artwork myself for <em>Puzzle Panel</em>, as well as much of the sound, and it still cost me over $1,000 to make.  To a student, that is a great deal of money.  I charged a dollar for the game, but in the end I recouped <em>none</em> of the cost of creating it.  I don&#8217;t regret a thing, but this illustrates the point that game development is anything but a quick and surefire way to get rich.  For every developer making money on their games, there are literally tens of thousands who sink in countless hours and significant money, only to receive nothing in return.  That being the case, I don&#8217;t give much credence to the argument that developers such as <em>Tobar</em>&#8217;s are just in it for the money.</p>

</div>




<p>Thus far I&#8217;ve been writing specifically about indie developers.  I&#8217;d be remiss to not mention that established, big-budget studios often clone each other&#8217;s games, or worse, the games of indie developers.  I&#8217;m much less sympathetic to this; like Jonathan Holmes with <em>Tobar</em>, I certainly frowned when I read about <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/capcom-copies-splosion-man-with-maxplosion-191411.phtml">Capcom&#8217;s obvious copy of indie hit <em>&#8216;Splosion Man</em></a>.  But although I personally find this distasteful, I still don&#8217;t see a great need for alarm.  A well-made, original title which has found an audience has little to fear from pretenders.</p>




<p>Now, please don&#8217;t misunderstand me.  I am by no means saying that every developer should just go out and rip off the biggest franchise he can because there&#8217;s nothing wrong with unoriginality.  On the contrary, innovation and creativity should be encouraged and rewarded, and while I think it&#8217;s fine for hobbyist programmers to start out by mimicking their favorite titles, we should definitely turn a more critical eye to established studios who have the time, budget and experience to be original but are content with releasing an endless stream of sequels, clones and remakes.  But please, let&#8217;s cut the indie developers some slack.  Cloning a popular game to make a quick buck is simply not a winning proposition.  Regardless of their originality, regardless of their financial success or failure, I can assure you that indies do it for the love.</p>


<p><sup>1</sup> <small>Although it has its own unique art style, I count <em>Angry
Birds</em> among the clones for its striking similarities to Armor Games&#8217;
<em>Crush the Castle</em>.</small><br/>
<sup>2</sup> <small>Ironically, the &#8220;negative&#8221; publicity <em>Tobar</em> is generating will probably help its sales more than anything else could have.</small></p>

<time datetime="2011-06-29T22:27:00-07:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jun 29<span>th</span>, 2011</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a discussion today about what lambda functions are used for, how they differ from regular functions, and why they&#8217;re important. I thought I&#8217;d reproduce it here, as it seems that lambdas are often thought of as confusing and obscure. The truth is that they&#8217;re very simple, and also quite powerful. While they can reduce readability if used incorrectly, they do serve an important purpose, and those who understand them should have nothing to fear from them. This discussion pertains specifically to lambda functions as they&#8217;re implemented in Python, but they&#8217;re very similar in other languages where they&#8217;re available.<!--more--></p>

<p>I think the best way to explain lambdas is with a simple example. Say you want a switch statement. Python doesn’t have them, but what you can do is set up a dictionary and get a value out of it, which is sort of like a switch. However, you can&#8217;t do this&#8230;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">my_dict</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">my_func1</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">my_func2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>          <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>&#8230;because the functions will be evaluated when the dictionary is initialized, so if they modify any state (or if they just take a while to execute) you’ll get bad behaviour. Functions are first class objects in Python, so you could insert the functions into the dictionary like so…</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">my_dict</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">my_func1</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">my_func2</span>
</span><span class='line'>          <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>&#8230;but that doesn&#8217;t work either, because you don’t know how many (or which) arguments you need to pass to the function when you pull it out of the dictionary. So, what to do?</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">my_dict</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">my_func1</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">my_func2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>          <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Lambdas solve the problem because they&#8217;re evaluated lazily. By being wrapped in
a lambda, the functions won’t be evaluated until the lambda itself is called.
Furthermore, you can use the lambda to normalize the parameters of each
function, so that you can always call it using <code>my_dict[my_var](x, y, z)</code>, even though the first function being called doesn’t actually make use of the z parameter. There is no other way to accomplish this in Python, besides a big long ugly list of ifs. (Obviously you’d normally reserve this technique for situations where you have more than two options.)</p>

<p>You can also use the laziness aspect of lambdas to refer to variables which haven&#8217;t been declared yet, although I&#8217;d recommend against that because it can become quite confusing. Anything within the lambda is evaluated only when the lambda is called.</p>

<p>And there you have it! Those are the basics of lambdas in Python. Of course, the above is only a trivial example of what can be accomplished with lambdas.  If you&#8217;d like to learn more, there&#8217;s a great write-up available <a title="Lambda functions in Python" href="http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/lambda_functions.hawk">here.</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>In September of last year I ditched my iPhone 3G and switched to the Android-powered HTC Desire (which I later sold in order to purchase a Desire Z, which sports a physical keyboard.)  I&#8217;m sad to report that I&#8217;m now considering switching back to iOS, after less than a year on the Android platform.  The following is an excerpt from an e-mail I wrote to a friend of mine whom I&#8217;d describe as a fervent Android evangelist, detailing some of the frustrations I have with the operating system and why I feel that I might be better served by iOS.  I&#8217;ve edited it slightly to make it more readable for anyone who might come across this blog.</em></p>




<p><em>I really want to like the Android platform, and writing this gave me no joy.  There are two reasons I&#8217;m posting it here, though.  The first is simply that the purpose of this website is for me to post about my programming and my experiences with technology (as well as whatever else catches my fancy.)  The second is that I hope that sharing my honest opinion about Android might be helpful to anyone considering a phone purchase.</em></p>


<!--more-->




<p>As mentioned on Twitter, my number one complaint is having to use custom ROMs.  <em>There are always problems</em> with custom ROMs.  <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/">CyanogenMod 7</a> caused my phone to reboot at random.  I also had problems with the Contacts app crashing.  All of these issues persisted throughout multiple versions of CM7 up to and including final.</p>




<ul>
    <li>With the ROM I&#8217;m using now (a custom Sense ROM, can&#8217;t remember the exact name), I can&#8217;t set the SSID/password on my WiFi hotspot because Settings crashes when I try to.  I seriously haven&#8217;t used a single custom ROM that hasn&#8217;t had some issues with it.</li>
    <li>You mentioned that Google is promising quicker updates, but I&#8217;ll believe it when I see it.  Are they actually forcing manufacturers to do this in order to use Android branding or get Google apps, or are they just asking nicely?  The latter won&#8217;t work.  And as far as I know, all that the Android update committee has promised is 18 months of updates following the launch of a new device.  So does that mean if I release a device and then push a point release to consumers 17 months later, I&#8217;ve fulfilled that? All I see here is flowery language, and frankly I don&#8217;t think anything is going to improve.<br /><br />

The fact is that it&#8217;s not profitable for these manufacturers to update existing devices when they could spend the same development effort on releasing another six phones, so unless Google does something to change that, nothing will happen.</li>
</ul>




<p>The rest are in no particular order:</p>




<ul>
    <li>No good Exchange client available.  Even Touchdown, which is expensive, is pretty bad.  The HTC client is okay, but it <del datetime="2011-06-12T02:36:52+00:00">doesn&#8217;t support important features like threading.</del> [I later realized that this is untrue; the HTC client does support threading.  I still find it cumbersome to use, and I&#8217;ve previously had problems with it failing to send messages without any notification of the failure.  That&#8217;s a pretty big problem when you&#8217;re using it for work e-mail.]</li>
    <li>Launcher redraw, agghhhhhh.  Sense is horrendous for this, but I much prefer the built-in Sense apps to their Google alternatives, so I feel like I&#8217;m stuck using it.  Even on stock Android, it seems like I can&#8217;t really use live wallpapers or I have to wait for the launcher to reload all the time.</li>
    <li>It&#8217;s annoying that when I read an e-mail in Gmail on my computer, the notification for it stays in my notification bar.  Also, my Gmail push seems to have stopped working of late.  To be fair, it remains to be seen how the new iPhone notification system handles these things.</li>
    <li>I&#8217;ve noticed that with multiple IM clients (specifically, AIM and eBuddy) if I leave them running in the background while I&#8217;m doing other things like browsing the Internet, I&#8217;ll eventually get signed out or the app will close.  I don&#8217;t know if this is just because they&#8217;re not written correctly, but it&#8217;s annoying; IM is the only thing I really use background applications for and it doesn&#8217;t seem to work consistently.</li>
    <li>I often have trouble sending/receiving MMS.  It&#8217;s frustrating when someone sends me an MMS and I have to ask them to e-mail it to me instead because it won&#8217;t download.</li>
    <li>Camera quality on the Desire Z is pretty bad.  I&#8217;m certain the iPhone 4 is better in this department.  I feel like my Desire Z&#8217;s camera is actually worse than my Desire&#8217;s camera for still photos (although it&#8217;s better for video.)  This isn&#8217;t a strike against Android in particular, but the problem of lower-quality hardware is endemic to the platform in a certain sense.</li>
    <li>A lot of apps in the Android market are just very poor quality. The iPhone app store has its fair share of bad apps, but I still feel like the average quality is much higher there.  In particular, any app that&#8217;s available for both platforms is almost always better on iPhone.  A prime example is Facebook.  The Android client was horribly broken for several weeks, and regardless of that, it just doesn&#8217;t support the same feature set as the iPhone version (e.g. watching videos.)</li>
    <li>I complained about this even before I bought an Android phone, but the Android operating system is sometimes just not very responsive.  Scrolling is sometimes smooth, but rarely as smooth as on iPhone/Windows Phone 7.  Minor annoyance, but an annoyance nonetheless.</li>
    <li>I&#8217;m not sure if you&#8217;re familiar with the life cycle of an app in Android, but basically every different screen you can go to in an app is a separate &#8220;activity&#8221;&mdash;essentially a separate application.  <em>What were they thinking</em> in designing it like this? It causes so many problems.  Any time the &#8220;state&#8221; of the phone changes (e.g. you rotate the device, the phone leaves/enters roaming, etc.) the activity is destroyed and re-created unless developers manually override this behavior.  This is why, for instance, the keyboard often disappears if you have it open and then rotate the phone.  (Highly polished apps like Twitter handle rotation properly, but don&#8217;t be fooled; it&#8217;s not the default behavior.  Many other apps do not handle rotation very well.)  Other examples of activity recreation problems include pop-up dialog boxes disappearing and fields losing focus.</li>
    <li>Editing text sucks; I find that my phone never seems to do what I want it to when I&#8217;m trying to highlight or copy and paste some text.</li>
    <li>I&#8217;ve had problems on both of my Android phones with the music player pausing in the middle of a song at random.  This has happened in multiple different media players.  It&#8217;s as though the phone thinks the headphones are being removed when they are in fact still in place.</li>
    <li>I like being able to set alarm/ringer/media volume separately (although the iPhone can also do this), but I don&#8217;t like that the defaults on Android aren&#8217;t very sensible.  For instance, if I have my ringer silenced, it probably means that I also want my media silenced.  But that&#8217;s not what happens if I just use the volume button; I have to actually go into settings and change the media volume separately.</li>
    <li>Sometimes Google Talk just flat out refuses to start for me until I reboot my phone.  This happened on multiple ROMs.  On the Desire I noticed that it seemed to refuse to start when I was low on internal storage.  I&#8217;m not sure why it does it on my Desire Z.  This should be a core platform feature on par with BBM, but it seems to be very poorly supported.</li>
    <li>From a developer perspective, I hate paying a development fee to Apple to be able to install my apps on a non-jailbroken device.  I hate that once you&#8217;ve written an iPhone app, they basically blackmail you into continuing to pay them because otherwise they take down your app, which means that it may not be accessible to paying customers if they need to wipe their phone and re-install their apps.  I hate their greedy policies with regards to content subscriptions.  I hate their underhanded payment system which is, as a matter of statistical certainty, allowing them to make interest on millions of dollars that are nominally owed to developers but will never actually be paid.  In general, I hate that they treat their developers like serfs just because they can, even though those same developers made their platform what it is today.<br /><br />

I hope that properly illustrates how much I hate Apple&#8217;s policies, and I hope that it underscores the significance of what I&#8217;m about to say: from a pragmatic perspective, I&#8217;d <em>still</em> rather be developing for iOS because Google&#8217;s development tools are <em>complete garbage.</em> I write all my code in vim, so I&#8217;m really not that picky, but I can only take so much of using Eclipse and having it literally <em>delete</em> my art assets from the file system.  (Not just removing them from the project - it literally deletes the files, seemingly at random.  I&#8217;ve never lost any work because of this, but it&#8217;s extremely frustrating nevertheless.)  Not to mention the Android emulator: it&#8217;s practically unusable for regular apps, and for games, forget about it.  You&#8217;re lucky if you get 5 FPS.<br /><br />

Even if I buy an iPhone, I do still want to finish my game for Android.  The code is cross-platform, so if I could compile and test it using Xcode in the meantime&#8230; even just using the iPhone simulator, since it can actually run games at a reasonable framerate&#8230; it would save me a lot of headaches.  Either way I&#8217;ll have to compile my app for Windows or iOS to do any marketing; taking screenshots of an Android app is difficult, and taking video is, as far as I can tell, impossible unless you have a phone with HDMI out and a capture card.  Ridiculous.</li>

    <li>The behavior of the back button is inconsistent, and developers use it as
    a crutch rather than thinking about and carefully designing a proper workflow
    through their applications.  I was arguing about this behavior with someone on
    Reddit a while ago, and I found a good comment on Hacker News about it:
    <br/><br />

<blockquote>I just got an Android with that great Virgin Mobile deal, and I was surprised
at just how much the Back button is used in almost all contexts. It&#8217;s severely
overloaded: want to get out of an on-screen keyboard? Back. Want to move back
a screen? Back, except when it&#8217;s Google Reader that opened a Browser window,
in which case it takes you back to the previous page that Browser had. Back
through a menu? Back. Back to a previous page in Browser? Back.

It&#8217;s as if people just substituted the button for any instance in human language
where &#8220;back&#8221; was used.&#8221;</blockquote>

&#8230;(and another)&#8230;<br /><br />

<blockquote>&#8220;Back&#8221; to some random place most of the time.<br />
1. receive email notification for two messages.<br />
2. click notification bar<br />
3. go to gmail app.<br />
4. open first message and click a link.<br />
5. you are now in the browser. (clicking back will close the window, but you want to read it later!)<br />
6. you long press HOME button (hoping to select gmail and read the other message)<br />
7. gmail is not in the open app list (WTH?!)\<br />
8. you curse, click home, find the gmail app, click it.<br />
9. now you are on the message with the link<br />
10. press BACK<br />
11. now you are on the message list (aha! not you home screen you came from!)<br />
12. click the 2nd message and read it
</blockquote>

In fairness, I&#8217;m of two minds about this because the back button does save a lot of screen real-estate by removing the necessity for on-screen navigation controls.  However, I&#8217;m not sure how much of an advantage that is in the face of the confusion it sometimes causes.</li>

<li>[This wasn&#8217;t included in my e-mail to my friend, because I didn&#8217;t know about it at the time.  I&#8217;m adding it now because it&#8217;s fairly important.] Android can actually <em><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=12765846">lose SMS messages.</a></em>  That&#8217;s completely unacceptable on a phone.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The week before last, whilst browsing <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> I came across a blog by the name of <a href="http://android-gripes.tumblr.com/">&#8220;Android Gripes.&#8221;</a> The name is perhaps a bit misleading, as it&#8217;s not actually a blog by an Android user hoping to spur Google into making UI improvements, as I would have expected.  It is, rather, a blog by a self-proclaimed Apple fanboy (though he&#8217;s recently <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/glbjz/android_gripes_why_do_apps_from_the_same_company/c1ogv3q">edited his about page to remove that admission</a>) complaining about Android for the sake of&#8230; well, complaining about Android.<!--more--></p>

<p>That might be a little unfair.  Perhaps I should let the author speak for himself:</p>

<blockquote>I have constantly heard many gripes about Android. Recently I happened to have access to some Android phones and use them in a daily base. The more I use Android, the more I feel that Android is indeed a half-baked OS, its UX/UI is horrible and various hardwares are poorly designed. It’s true that those phones are working like smartphones, better than feature phones from old school, but they ignore a lot of the details. Just for Google’s own benefit, they helped handset manufactures brutally dumped a huge amount of unpolished devices to the market. They made people think this is how smartphones should work. This is so unfair to consumers. <strong>IMHO, it is no different from committing a crime.</strong> That’s why I made the cartoon of &#8220;Android Gripes&#8221; as a Monopoly &#8220;Go Directly To Jail&#8221; card showing an Android on it.

As much as I believe in Apple, I think everybody deserves great user experience, especially when it comes to phones. I think it is my mission to let more people know that Android does not provide you that. Android only provides inferior user experience. You either admit it and bear with it, or go for better alternatives. That’s why I started writing this blog.</blockquote>


<p>(Emphasis added.)  English is not the author&#8217;s native language, so you&#8217;ll have to excuse the occasionally odd grammar.  It&#8217;s immediately apparent that the author&#8217;s stated opinion of Android is patently absurd; bad UI/UX can have many negative consequences, but it is certainly not criminal.  Redditors have also <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/glbjz/android_gripes_why_do_apps_from_the_same_company/">pointed out</a> that a number of comparisons the Android Gripes author makes are somewhat unfair.  For instance, he <a href="http://android-gripes.tumblr.com/post/4409289546/why-do-apps-from-the-same-company-look-worse-on-android">compares old, oudated Android apps</a> against apps which were recently updated on iOS, and misleadingly remarks on &#8220;extra&#8221; (meaning blank) space in the Facebook app.  The blank space in question <em>does</em> contain content when one is signed into a legitimate profile.</p>

<p>With all of that said, I&#8217;m not writing this post to refute the Android Gripes author.  I actually agree with an unfortunate number of his points.  While there&#8217;s a lot that can be said about where the iPhone&#8217;s UI/UX fails (I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.mlindgren.ca/archives/151">previously mentioned</a> their complete lack of a workable notification system), excuses and rationalizations won&#8217;t do anything to improve the state of Android apps.  Even if you believe that Android&#8217;s UI/UX is better than Apple&#8217;s (and I do feel that that&#8217;s a hard case to make), I think it&#8217;s undeniable that there&#8217;s room for improvement.  It&#8217;s certainly worth mentioning that some of the Android Gripe&#8217;s authors examples are misleading, but what&#8217;s more important is that we—that is to say, Android developers—ask ourselves where we&#8217;re failing users, why it&#8217;s happening, and what we can do to improve the platform.  In a future post, I&#8217;ll offer my perspective on where Android could be improved.</p>
