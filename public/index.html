  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of Sam Harris&#8217; writing, but I can&rsquo;t deny that he is a
controversial figure, to say the least. As one of the the &ldquo;four horsemen&rdquo; of
so-called New Atheism, he has met with much ire since the publication of his
first book&mdash;not only from religious adherents, but also from secular
liberals, many of whom seem to willfully and perhaps even <em>gleefully</em>
misinterpret him.  Although <em><a href="http://www.samharris.org/free-will">Free Will</a>,</em>
published in 2012, courts less political controversy than Harris&#8217; other works,
it has nevertheless met with a prickly reception from, most notably, fellow
&ldquo;horseman&rdquo; and professional philosopher Dan Dennett.</p>

<p>In <em>Free Will</em>, Harris lays out a case against the philosophical concept of the
same name. There are many facets to his argument, but I think his primary claims
can be enumerated as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Scientific research shows that &ldquo;determinism, in every sense relevant to human
behavior, is true. Unconscious neural events determine our thoughts and
actions&mdash;and are themselves determined by prior causes of which we are
subjectively unaware.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Determinism cannot be reconciled with (what Harris believes is) the popular
conception of free will. (In philosophical terms, Harris takes an
<em>incompatibilist</em> stance on the relationship of determinism to free will, and
spends much of the book arguing against <em>compatibilism</em>.)</li>
<li>Even if determinism were not true (due to, for example, randomness in quantum
events), free will would <em>still</em> not be possible, as in that case &ldquo;[our wills
would be] the product of chance and we [would not be] responsible for them.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Upon introspection, &ldquo;free will doesn&rsquo;t even correspond to any <em>subjective</em>
fact about us &hellip; Seeming facts of volition merely arise spontaneously (whether
caused, uncaused, or probabilistically inclined, it makes no difference) and
cannot be traced to a point of origin in our conscious minds.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>


<p>Harris begins with the scientific evidence for the determined nature of human
behavior. He writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>The physiologist Benjamin Libet famously used EEG to show that activity in the
brain&rsquo;s motor cortex can be detected some 300 milliseconds before a person
feels that he has decided to move. Another lab extended this work using
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): Subjects were asked to press one
of two buttons while watching a &ldquo;clock&rdquo; composed of a random sequence of
letters appearing on a screen. They reported which letter was visible at the
moment they decided to press one button or the other. The experimenters found
two brain regions that contained information about which buttons subjects
would press a full <em>7 to 10 seconds</em> before the decision was consciously made.
More recently, direct recordings from the cortex showed that the activity of
merely 256 neurons was sufficient to predict with 80 percent accuracy a
person&rsquo;s decision to move 700 milliseconds before he became aware of it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>(Harris provides sources for each of these claims in the book, but I am not
reproducing the citations here for the sake of brevity.) These findings
are pretty remarkable in their own right, and will probably be quite unsettling
to some readers. They&rsquo;re also likely the only part of the book that will seem
truly novel to those already highly schooled in philosophy; the debate about
free will has been going on for centuries, and it seems unlikely to me that
<em>Free Will</em> contains any truly novel philosophical arguments. Even so, I&rsquo;m not
sure the discussion of these studies will actually work to Harris&#8217; advantage.
The core of his argument <em>is</em> philosophical, but some readers are certain to get
caught up in overthinking the scientific claims even though, as Harris himself
states, nothing actually depends on them.</p>

<p>In fact, Harris goes so far as to say that even if one believes that
consciousness originates in a &ldquo;soul&rdquo; which is separate from and unconstrained by
our physical brains, that <em>still</em> would not make free will feasible: a soul
would not change the fact that we do not have full awareness of, let alone
control over, the origins of our thoughts and intentions. To use one of Harris&#8217;
examples:</p>

<blockquote><p>Why did I order beer instead of wine? Because I prefer beer. Why do I prefer
it? I don&rsquo;t know, but I generally have no need to ask. Knowing that I like
beer more than wine is all I need to know to function in a restaurant.
Whatever the reason, I prefer one taste to the other. Is there freedom in
this? None whatsoever. Would I magically reclaim my freedom if I decided to
spite my preference and order wine instead? No, because the roots of this
intention would be as obscure as the preference itself.</p></blockquote>

<p>Even with that example, I suspect this claim is likely to confuse many readers,
as a naÃ¯ve reading of it will make it seem flatly absurd: you probably <em>can</em>
explain most of your thoughts and intentions with reference to your values,
preferences, duties, etc.  But Harris&#8217; point is that if you follow this chain of
causation back as far as possible, you will inevitably arrive at something you
either can&rsquo;t explain or have no control over. You might say that you prefer beer
over wine (or vice versa) because beer is more pleasing to your taste buds. But
<em>why</em> is it more pleasing? Probably, ultimately, because of your genes.
Obviously, you have no hand in that. (I hope I&rsquo;m not muddying the water by
adding that whatever you <em>think</em> your reasons for a given decision are,
<a href="http://www.texasenterprise.utexas.edu/article/do-you-make-buying-decisions-based-logic-or-emotion-tale-two-chickens">studies have shown</a>
that many of the decisions we make are actually rationalized after the fact.)</p>

<p>So far, Harris&#8217; argument has hinged on determinism being true. I think Harris is
being accurate when he states that arguing against determinism is no longer
&ldquo;philosophically respectable,&rdquo; but nevertheless there are some who persist in
doing so. In fact, often as a way to salvage traditional notions of free will,
&ldquo;some scientists and philosophers hope that chance or quantum uncertainty can
make room for [it].&rdquo; This argument doesn&rsquo;t stand up to much scrutiny, though,
and Harris dispatches it with suitable brevity, observing that &ldquo;[c]hance
occurences are by definition ones for which I can claim no responsibility. And
if certain of my behaviors are truly the result of chance, they should be
surprising <em>even to me</em>. How would neurological ambushes of this kind make me
free?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harris reserves a couple chapters at the end of the book to discuss the
practical consequences of giving up one&rsquo;s belief in free will. I found these
chapters somewhat perfunctory and unconvincing. In fairness, they are tangential
to the actual purpose of the book, but given how deeply the assumption of free
will is rooted in human psychology and society, I would have liked to see a more
thorough discussion here. Moreover, I think Harris could have made room for that
by eschewing some of his examples of how we <em>feel</em> free but really aren&rsquo;t, many
of which are reducible to the same observations and therefore feel repetitive
despite the book&rsquo;s short length.</p>

<p>On the impact of disbelief in free will on our mental health, Harris writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many people worry that free will is a necessary illusion&mdash;and that
without it we will fail to live creative and fulfilling lives. This concern
isn&rsquo;t entirely unjustified. One study found that having subjects read an
argument against the existence of free will made them more likely to cheat on
a subsequent exam. Another found such subjects to be less helpful and more
aggressive. It is surely conceivable that knowing (or emphasizing) certain
truths about the human mind could have unfortunate psychological and/or
cultural consequences. However, I&rsquo;m not especially worried about degrading
the morality of my readers by publishing this book.</p></blockquote>

<p>(Again, Harris provides citations for the studies he references.) Harris goes on
to justify the last sentence with reference to his personal experience of losing
his sense of free will, stating that it has &ldquo;[increased his] feelings of
compassion and forgiveness, and [diminished his] sense of entitlement to the
fruits of my own good luck.&rdquo; I suppose his experience shows that it is
<em>possible</em> for losing one&rsquo;s belief in free will to have positive (or at least
neutral) psychological consequences, but given that research shows that this is
not the typical result, I don&rsquo;t think that a personal anecdote should be enough
to set us at ease. Of course, it should go without saying that this has no
bearing on the existence or non-existence of free will.</p>

<p>Harris&#8217; discussion of morality is a bit more satisfying. He observes that,
without a belief in free will, retributive justice becomes difficult if not
impossible to justify: &ldquo;Once we recognize that even the most terrifying
predators are, in a very real sense, unlucky to be who they are, the logic of
hating (as opposed to fearing) them begins to unravel.&rdquo; This is eminently
compatible with modern liberal understandings of how justice should operate.
Happily, the logic behind rehabilitation, incarceration for the safety of
society, and punishment as a means of deterrence, remains intact: &ldquo;It may seem
paradoxical to hold people responsible for what happens in their corner of the
universe, but once we break the spell of free will, we can do this precisely to
the degree that it is useful.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Compatibilism</h4>

<p>Astute readers may have noticed that I mentioned that Harris argues against
comaptibilism, but that I neglected to actually address those arguments in the
preceding paragraphs.  That is because Harris&#8217; incompatibilist position is both
somewhat complex, and certainly the most controversial part of <em>Free Will</em>, at
least among philosophers.  Indeed, it is Harris&#8217; dismissal of compatibilism that
so displeased professional philosopher Dan Dennett that he felt compelled to
write a <a href="http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/reflections-on-free-will">criticism</a>
of the book that is, as Harris observed, &ldquo;nearly as long as the book itself.&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m going to refer to both Dennett&rsquo;s criticism and Harris&#8217;
<a href="http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-marionettes-lament#foot_1">response to it</a>
throughout this section, which is unorthodox for a review, but in this case I
think those works make an extremely valuable addendum to the book itself, as
they expose (to a greater degree than the book does) the core of the
disagreement between Dennett&rsquo;s compatibilism and Harris&#8217; incompatibilism. (Where
I quote Harris, it will be from the text of <em>Free Will</em>, unless otherwise
noted.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consider what it would actually take to have free will,&rdquo; Harris writes. &ldquo;You
would need to be aware of all the factors that determine your thoughts and
actions, and you would need to have complete control over those factors.&rdquo; Harris
takes this as, I think, basically axiomatic, but compatibilists disagree.
Dennett writes that &ldquo;[s]uch &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; freedom is, of course, an incoherent
idea,&rdquo; which is true, but I think this is actually Harris&#8217; point: this is the
free will that people <em>suppose</em> they have, but when one thinks about the
implications of that belief, it is shown to be nonsensical.</p>

<p>Here we arrive at another disagreement between Dennett and Harris: Dennett
argues that Harris doesn&rsquo;t actually know what people in general think about free
will, and that &ldquo;suitably expressed questionnaires might well prove [Harris]
wrong.&rdquo; In fact, he provides a
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary;jsessionid=E39CD0E070F0F373146843196443CF02?doi=10.1.1.364.2437">study</a>
which he purports does exactly that: polls conducted but <em>Nahmias et al.</em> appear
to show that people with no philosophical background actually do have
compatibilist notions of free will.</p>

<p>In his response to Dennett, Harris disputes the validity of this study, nothing
that &ldquo;Nahmias and his coauthors repeatedly worry that their experimental
subjects didn&rsquo;t really understand the implications of determinism&mdash;and on
my reading, they had good reason to be concerned. &hellip; More than anything, this
research suggests that people find the idea of libertarian free will so
intuitively compelling that it is very difficult to get them to think clearly
about determinism.&rdquo; I have to say that I am in agreement with Harris here.
Having read the paper, it is not at all clear to me that <em>Nahmias et al</em>
accurately assessed their subjects&#8217; compatibilist or incompatibilist
preferences. They write:</p>

<blockquote><p>Despite our efforts to induce participants to make their judgments based on a
conditional acceptance of the scenario, it is likely that some did not do so,
as evidenced by those who missed the manipulation check on the back of the
surveys, which tested whether they recognized the deterministic nature of the
scenario. Some of these participants may have even been expressing
incompatibilist intuitions, e.g., by asserting that Jeremy acts of his own
free will and then (mis)responding that the scenario therefore could <em>not</em>
have been describing a fully deterministic situation.</p></blockquote>

<p>I agree with Harris that this is a very valid concern. <em>Nahmias et al</em> note that
&ldquo;many&rdquo; participants found the scenarios they used &ldquo;implausible or impossible,&rdquo;
and that in one case, &ldquo;almost all participants&rdquo; believed the scenario was
impossible. While participants&#8217; stated reasons for this belief varied, it seems
entirely plausible to me, and perhaps even likely, that a significant number of
participants could not effectively reason about the situations being presented
because of strong attachments to beliefs that contradict the scenarios&#8217;
premises.</p>

<p>In any case, Dennett argues that even if people do in fact have a natural
tendency towards libertarian incompatibilism (i.e. they believe in free will but
do not believe that it is compatible with determinism, and, perhaps
consequentially, disbelieve determinism), this might just show &ldquo;that most people
are suffering from a sort of illusion that could be replaced by wisdom.&rdquo; He
seems to believe that the illusion in this &ldquo;folk conception of free will&rdquo; is
based on Cartesian dualism, and that the goal of compatibilism is to correct
replace this &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo; with something more &ldquo;scientifically sound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dennett wonders why Harris objects to this project and suggests that Harris
views Cartesian dualism as a &ldquo;psychological fact,&rdquo; but this is a misconstrual:
Harris is simply drawing a distinction between what we conciously experience and
all of the unconscious experiences our brains are engaged in at every moment, of
which we have no (subjective) knowledge. This is an important distinction,
because Dennett&rsquo;s compatibilist view of free will is predicated on the fact that
&ldquo;we are coterminous with everything that goes on inside our bodies, whether we
are conscious of it or not&rdquo; (Harris&#8217; words).  But as Harris points out, true as
this is, our subjective, concious experiences <em>are</em> actually only proxies for
the underlying neural states in our brains; we simply do not have concious
access to the totality of ourselves. This is not simply a misunderstanding that
can be corrected; it seems to be a biological fact.</p>

<p>As contentious as their disagreements are, Dennett and Harris actually agree on
most of the points discussed in <em>Free Will</em>. Most importantly, they agree that
one can&rsquo;t be <em>ultimately</em> responsible for his or her thoughts and intentions,
because, as previously discussed, the chain of causal links will eventually lead
to something out of his or her control. The principle disagreement seems to be
that Harris views this as an intractable problem for the idea of free will,
whereas Dennett does not, because one can still be &ldquo;partially, largely
responsible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this seems so obvious to me as to be useless as a concept, because&hellip; ???</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Despite the length at which I&rsquo;ve discussed <em>Free Will</em> and the subsequent clash
between Dennett and Harris, there is much more that I did not cover. If you
found this discussion even moderately interesting, then you&rsquo;ll certainly enjoy
the book, and I do recommend reading both Dennett&rsquo;s criticism and Harris&#8217;
response to it as well. Philosophical concepts can be extremely difficult to
grapple with, and reading about them second-hand is rarely beneficial to
understanding.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed reading <em>Free Will</em>, and I found myself agreeing with pretty
much all of it, but I hesitate to call it <em>convincing</em>: I was already skeptical
of the idea of free will given our scientific understanding of determinism, so I
really didn&rsquo;t need much convincing. For those who feel a deep sense of
attachment to the idea of free will, I am not sure Harris&#8217; short book (at less
than 100 pages long) will be sufficient to convince you otherwise.  As the
debate between Dennett and Harris demonstrates, the concept itself can be so
nebulous as to make it difficult to even discuss. This may also prove an
obstacle for those who lack exposure to philosophical reasoning, as the
arguments can sometimes seem to devolve into semantic disputes. Conversely,
those with a <em>significant</em> philosophical background may find <em>Free Will</em>
uninteresting as they&rsquo;re likely to have read similar arguments before. For
everyone else, though, it comes highly recommended: this is the rare sort of
book that could really have a profound impact on a person, and it can be read in
a sitting, so there&rsquo;s really not much to lose.</p>

<p>Well, except your sense of autonomy, I suppose.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&rsquo;ve ever read OkCupid&rsquo;s popular <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/">OkTrends</a> blog,
you&rsquo;re already familiar with the work of Christian Rudder. As OkCupid&rsquo;s resident
mathematician and one of its founders, he has been writing for years about
statistical trends related to dating and attraction, leveraging OkCupid&rsquo;s
vast database of traits about, and interactions between, its millions and millions
of users. OkTrends produced numerous interesting and surprising results, and it
developed a significant following before going quiet for the better part of
three years beginning in 2011.</p>

<p>Now, Rudder is back with
<a href="http://dataclysm.org/"><em>Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One&rsquo;s Looking</em></a>,
which expands on OkTrends by drawing from a wider variety of sources (including
Facebook, Google, and Twitter, in addition to OkCupid and other dating sites)
and discussing a more diverse set of topics.  Organized into three themed
sections which focus on, respectively, unity, division, and individuality, the
book explores what data can tell us about gender, sexuality, race, identity,
community, and other sociopolitical questions.  The discussion is consistently
balanced and neutral, which is important when dealing with such potentially
charged subjects, but Rudder also manages to inject enough of his personality
and characteristic style to keep the book enjoyable throughout.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has been about a month and a half now since The Elder Scrolls Online was
released, and it&rsquo;s received
<a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-elder-scrolls-online">generally mixed reviews</a>.
Despite some undeniable technical issues and a handful of design flaws, it&rsquo;s a
great game and more than a bit underrated in my opinion; if you&rsquo;re a fan of The
Elder Scrolls <em>or</em> an MMO aficionado, you owe it to yourself to give ESO a try.
I&rsquo;ll explain why.</p>

<p>First, by way of qualifications, I should mention my history with the Elder
Scrolls series. I didn&rsquo;t play Arena or Daggerfall, so I haven&rsquo;t been following
the series since its inception, but Morrowind captured hundreds of hours worth
of my attention and made a huge impression on my taste in games&mdash;it was
unlike anything I&rsquo;d ever played at the time, and not even other Elder Scrolls
games have quite managed to recapture that magic for me.  Oblivion was, at
first, quite awe-inspiring, but once the captivating new graphics wore thin, it
ultimately seemed shallow and uninspired compared to Morrowind. Skyrim was a
return to form, with better and more varied environments, a more interesting
story, and improvements to game mechanics all around&mdash;in addition to, once
again, remarkable visuals. In short, I&rsquo;ve been an Elder Scrolls fan for more
than 12 years now, so although I don&rsquo;t go <em>all the way</em> back, I have a good
basis for comparison.</p>

<p>The Elder Scrolls Online came as a surprise, being announced less than a year
after Todd Howard indicated that
<a href="http://massively.joystiq.com/2011/08/31/bethesdas-todd-howard-not-interested-in-an-elder-scrolls-mmo/">Bethesda had no interest in an Elder Scrolls MMO</a>.
In fact, at that point ESO had been in development for four years, but Howard
may not have known and certainly would not have been at liberty to reveal that.
At any rate, my initial reaction was extreme skepticism; I doubted that the best
aspects of The Elder Scrolls could be preserved when introduced to the MMO
formula. As more details were revealed about the game&rsquo;s design and mechanics, I
grew more interested, but I after playing the beta I was again left with
lukewarm impressions. Still, something about it kept nagging at me, and I
couldn&rsquo;t stop watching Twitch streams of ESO as launch drew nearer. Eventually,
I decided to buy it just in time for early launch. Since then, I&rsquo;ve put in
nearly 150 hours, and that number would doubtless be much higher were it not for
the obligations of the real world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Five months ago, I <a href="/entry/2013/07/30/road-trip/">left off my last post</a> having
just left Canyonlands National Park, heading further south to visit Bryce Canyon
and Zion National Parks. I had booked a motel for the evening in Panguitch,
Utah, which is a three or four hour drive from Moab. The drive there was
uneventful, with relatively little in the way of scenery. I mostly followed the
interstate, until about an hour outside of Panguitch, where I exited onto state
route 89.</p>

<p>Route 89 winds through scrub desert, farmland, and several very small towns
nestled between modest mountains. I arrived in Panguitch and discovered that it,
too, is very small. In contrast to Moab, though, it didn&rsquo;t seem to have much of
a tourist draw despite its proximity to Bryce Canyon. As a foreigner, I have to
admit that I felt some apprehension at this. Although everyone I&rsquo;d met in Utah
so far had been very friendly and welcoming, a small, isolated town like
Panguitch is the kind of place where I imagined that I could encounter a
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKcJ-0bAHB4">Top Gear-esque redneck mob</a>.
Granted, I wasn&rsquo;t driving around with a purposefully offensive slogan on my car,
nor do I really have a discernible accent, but I still felt like a pretty
obvious outsider with my Washington plates and conspicuous blue car with absurd
spoiler.  I was relieved, then, when I checked in at the New Western Motel and
was greeted at the front desk by an older Indian man (who I presume is also the
owner); it was good to see that the population of Panguitch isn&rsquo;t completely
homogeneous.</p>

<p>If you read the previous post you might recall that I had only slept for a few
hours the previous night, as I was up around 3:30am to get pictures of Delicate
Arch at night. That being the case, I was exhausted by the time I checked into
my room, so I decided to nap for a few hours before heading to Bryce Canyon. It
might have just been because I was so tired, but I distinctly recall thinking
that the bed in my motel room was among the most comfortable I had ever slept
in.</p>

<p>I woke up around five or six in the evening and went to grab dinner from &ldquo;The
Pizza Place&rdquo; in the nearby town of Tropic. Yes, it&rsquo;s literally just called &ldquo;The
Pizza Place.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a nice little family-run business, and the pizza was pretty
good. I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that they had several copies of the Book of
Mormon available for guests to peruse. That didn&rsquo;t surprise me, given that I was
in Utah, but I did find it strange that most if not all of the books seemed to
be written in Danish.</p>

<p>I made it to the Bryce Amphitheater in Bryce Canyon National Park just in time
for sunset, and took the opportunity to walk the Rim Trail and take some
pictures. Unfortunately, as it was quickly becoming dark, I didn&rsquo;t have time to
go on any of the hiking trails or explore the rest of the park. I contemplated
spending another day in Panguitch and going on a horseback tour of Bryce Canyon,
but ultimately opted to leave for Zion National Park the next morning so that
I&rsquo;d have more time there.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love visiting new places. I&rsquo;ve lived in the United States for just over a year
now, and one of my favourite things about this country is how vast it is and how
many opportunities it presents for exploration. Canada is just slightly larger
than the United States, but it&rsquo;s also very sparsely populated north of, say,
Edmonton, so practically speaking I think one can explore much more of the
States while still maintaining access to the comforts of civilization.</p>

<p>To that end, I try to go on at least one long road trip every year. I&rsquo;m also one
of those people who actually enjoy driving, even for absurdly long stretches of
time; anything up to 12 hours per day on the road is fairly comfortable for me,
and even beyond that I don&rsquo;t find long trips all that tiring. I&rsquo;d much, much
rather drive 12 hours in my car than take a two hour plane trip.</p>

<p>My new car was also begging to be broken in on a long road trip. Although I had
a bit of a <a href="/entry/2013/06/09/the-subaru-saga/">rocky start with it</a>, all of the
issues have now been sorted out (or at least as sorted out as they&rsquo;ll ever be),
so it offered another compelling reason to take a long trip. And so it was that
I booked the 5th to 12th of July off of work and embarked on a 3,378 mile
(5,436km) drive from Redmond, Washington through Oregon, Idaho, and Nevada to
Utah, and then back home through Arizona, Nevada, California and Oregon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Or &ldquo;buying used cars is the worst and I will never do it ever again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I recently purchased a new-to-me 2011
<a href="http://www.subaru.com/vehicles/impreza-wrx/index.html">Subaru WRX STI</a> sedan.
I had been thinking about buying a new car for a long time&mdash;since I
graduated, more or less. Until I bought my Subaru, I owned an ageing Honda Civic
(1997, to be precise).  While it was a very capable and extremely reliable car
throughout the many years I owned it for, it was old enough that it lacked some
of the conveniences one expects in a car these days, such as power locks and
windows, and most importantly, air conditioning.  The lack of air conditioning
in particular made it  less than ideal for summer road trips, and more
importantly, it was in need of some moderately expensive maintenance, and it
didn&rsquo;t seem to make sense to me to spend much money on it given that the overall
value of the car was fairly low.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t go on many test drives before I purchased my Subaru, but I didn&rsquo;t feel
the need to; I had already spent months watching reviews, reading forums,
comparing specs and window shopping on AutoTrader. I knew I wanted a sporty car
with plenty of horsepower for under $40,000, and all-wheel drive was a must as I
go to the mountains nearly every weekend in the winter and almost as often in
the summer. Besides the STI, the Evo, MazdaSpeed3, and the Golf R were the best
contenders, but each had significant drawbacks with regard to my personal
preferences. The Evo has a notoriously lacklustre interior (not that the STI is
<em>a lot</em> better, to be fair); I don&rsquo;t like the way the MazdaSpeed3 looks, and the
Golf comes with the reputation of higher maintenance costs for German cars.</p>

<p>I also really like the Subaru community.
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/subaru">/r/subaru</a> is the largest manufacturer-specific
subreddit, and in addition to forums like <a href="http://forums.nasioc.com/">NASIOC</a>,
it comprises a vibrant community of enthusiastic Subaru owners. Of course other
brands have significant followings as well&mdash;particularly VW&mdash;but my
impression of the Subaru community is that it&rsquo;s less elitist and, in contrast to
the others, puts as much emphasis on what one can <em>do</em> with the cars as on the
cars themselves. To &ldquo;go Subaruing&rdquo; is a popular term for going out into the mud
or the snow or the sand or the bush and getting the car wet and dirty, and
having a ton of fun in the process.</p>

<p>The STI, then, was the clear winner in my eyes.  Truth be told, a WRX probably
would have been more than sufficient for my needs, but I generally prefer to put
down the extra money and be sure that I&rsquo;m getting the best product. And hey, one
only has so long to exercise the opportunity to be young and irresponsible!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In September I <a href="/entry/2012/09/14/social-networks-and-content-ownership/">wrote about</a>
my intention to develop a web application to share my photos. I made good
progress on it throughout September and early October, but for various reasons I
haven&rsquo;t been able to work on it much in the past month or so. Last weekend,
though, I was able to solve some blocking issues which were preventing me from
doing an alpha release. Those being dealt with, I&rsquo;ve now got a few of my albums
up at <a href="http://photos.mlindgren.ca/">photos.mlindgren.ca</a>; take a look and leave
a comment if you have any feedback.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t released the source code yet as there&rsquo;s still a great deal of work to
be done, and I&rsquo;m generally of the belief that dumping a bunch of unfinished,
messy code on Github with the hope that the community will sort it out is of
little benefit to anyone. My goal at this point is to do a beta release in a
two to three months or so and release the code at that point. That timeline is
anything but firm, though. This project is turning out to be much more work than
I expected (as projects are wont to do), and I expect to be fairly busy over the
next couple months.</p>

<p>Anyway, with the alpha version up and running, this seems like a good
opportunity to reflect on some of the issues I&rsquo;ve faced that complicated the
project, and on what remains to be done. </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>David Somers presents an
<a href="http://labs.newsint.co.uk/blog/2012/10/why-mozilla-persona-is-the-right-answer-to-the-question-of-identity/">excellent rundown</a>
of what
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/">Mozilla Persona</a> is and why it&rsquo;s
currently the best option for identity and authentication for web services. I&rsquo;ve
implemented authentication using Persona in the
<a href="http://blog.mlindgren.ca/entry/2012/09/14/social-networks-and-content-ownership/">photo album app</a>
I&rsquo;m working on, and I found it remarkably easy to integrate with my app. And, as
David explains, Persona is also much easier for users to understand than
competing platforms like OpenID. If you&rsquo;re a web developer, you really need to
add Persona support to your application as soon as
possible. It can be done in literally a matter of minutes, and if Persona takes
off the benefit to identity management on the Internet could be huge.</p>

<p>Perhaps my favourite thing about Persona is that it gives me the opportunity to
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Persona/Implementing_a_Persona_IdP">implement my own identity provider</a>,
which means I can have <em>complete</em> control over how I authenticate to any
Persona-consuming service. I could have <em>n</em>-factor authentication, with no limit
on the complexity or specificity of the factors besides my own imagination. For
example, I could generate SSL client certificates for each of my machines and
hardcode their thumbprints into my identity provider to ensure that it wouldn&rsquo;t
even service requests from machines I haven&rsquo;t explicitly added.  Or if I wanted
to get creative, I could have my identity provider generate a random temporary
key which I would have to retrieve via SSH (but this is less convenient and
probably also less secure than doing SSL client authentication.) The
possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>Perhaps an end is finally in sight to the frustration of having dozens upon
dozens of different accounts and passwords for various services,
<a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2011/12/04/fuck-passwords/">each with its own uniquely nonsensical password composition policy</a>.  Everyone needs to implement Persona&mdash;preferably yesterday.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been using Wordpress on various sites that I&rsquo;ve maintained for probably the
better part of a decade now. By most metrics, it&rsquo;s still very good blogging
software; I&rsquo;m not aware of any self-hostable alternative that can match
Wordpress in terms of the union of ease of use, feature set and flexibility that
it provides. That said, lately I&rsquo;ve been feeling that perhaps Wordpress is no
longer the right choice for my specific needs. These are my problems with it:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not very good for sharing source code. There are a multitude of plugins
available for syntax highlighting; the best of them seems to be
<a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">Alex Gorbatchev&rsquo;s Syntax Highlighter</a>,
which is used by
<a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> and is also what I was using on my blog.
But I&rsquo;ve had problems with the Wordpress converting some of the characters in
my code to HTML entities (e.g. <code>&amp;amp;</code> for &amp; ) which are then printed
literally by the plugin.</li>
<li>I find that more often than not Wordpress&#8217; visual editor is
insufficient for the formatting I want in my posts. That forces me to use
the raw HTML editor. That would be fine, except that Wordpress has a strange
sort of off-spec way of storing post HTML. Paragraph and line break tags are
omitted in the editor and the database, and are added when the page is
actually rendered to the client. This is okay, I guess, and I <em>think</em>
Wordpress is smart enough to not insert extra paragraph tags if you do wrap
your own paragraphs with them. Still, it leads to some unpredictability with
regard to how a post with hand-written HTML will actually be rendered.</li>
<li>A similar but worse problem occurs when you try to insert extra line breaks.
Even if you&rsquo;re using the raw HTML editor to insert <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> tags, Wordpress
will just get rid of them unless you insert additional non-breaking spaces
(<code>&amp;nbsp;</code>) so that it thinks the lines are non-empty. But! If you switch back
to the visual editor for any reason, even your <code>&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;</code> lines will be
wiped out. Even for &ldquo;average&rdquo; users I can&rsquo;t think of any situation in which
this &ldquo;feature&rdquo; would be desirable. If I put a bunch of extra newlines into
something I&rsquo;m writing, it is because <em>I want exactly that many newlines.</em> I
tend to not have much patience for software that thinks it&rsquo;s smarter than
I am; that is why I still write most of my code in <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>
and use hand-written makefiles in an age of
<acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym>s.</li>
<li>Never-ending updates. It seems like every time I log in there&rsquo;s a new update
to download. Wordpress has updates down to a one-click install process, so
this wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a problem except for the fact that
every time I have to update Wordpress warns me that I should back up my
database first. Why? Is there a significant possibility that the update might
break everything? It&rsquo;s probably just a
<acronym title="Cover Our Asses">COA</acronym>, and I back up my database
daily anyway, but this whole aspect of Wordpress makes me uneasy and I don&rsquo;t
want to have to deal with it any more. Even though I&rsquo;m covered for backups,
recovering from a botched update would undoubtedly be a nightmare.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress#Vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities.</a> One
of the big reasons that Wordpress is updated so frequently is that it has a
long history of security vulnerabilities, and more are still being discovered
and patched. This also means that if I don&rsquo;t log in frequently enough to
download new security patches, I&rsquo;m at risk of having my site compromised,
loaded up with malware and blacklisted by Google.</li>
<li><p>It&rsquo;s written in PHP. <a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">PHP sucks.</a>
(I can&rsquo;t link to that enough.) I don&rsquo;t want to be dogmatic about technology
choices; good software is good software regardless of what language it&rsquo;s
written in, and my primary desire is always to use whatever is best for the
task at hand. But lately I&rsquo;ve been pretty vocal, both here and in person with
friends and colleagues, about how bad PHP is. Continuing to rely on it
undermines my credibility on the issue and makes me a bit of a hypocrite.</p>

<p>And while this might seem trivial or pedantic, it&rsquo;s
actually one of the root causes of almost all of the issues above; the weird
HTML handling, inappropriate entity conversion, and security issues are all
due, at least in part, to bad design patterns popularized and perpetuated by
PHP. Wordpress still uses raw non-parameterized SQL queries; blogging software
built on a modern web framework with a proper
<acronym title="Object-Relational Mapping">ORM</acronym>
would not be plagued by SQL
injection exploits as Wordpress has been historically and probably continues
to be.</p></li>
<li>Wordpress supports themes so that you can customize the apperance of your
site, but editing them kind of sucks, because they&rsquo;re all written in PHP
instead of a proper templating language. Years ago I actually wrote a lot of
PHP, but I still find Wordpress templates pretty ugly and difficult to
understand; they seem more verbose than should really be necessary for what
they accomplish, and have, on average, more <code>&lt;?php ?&gt;</code> sections than a
keyboard has keys. (That analogy sucked. Sorry, it&rsquo;s late. What I&rsquo;m trying to
say is that there are a lot of them.)</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m not usually much enamoured with interview-style programming puzzles because I find that a lot of them are actually more akin to math problems, trivial to implement once you figure out the salient mathematical property. Â I think I have a decent intuition for math, and I certainly took enough math courses in high school and college to give me a solid foundation in the fundamentals of algebra, geometry, statistics, calculus, etc., but I&rsquo;m not confident enough in my math skills to be entirely comfortable being judged by my ability to exercise them.</p>

<p>There are some programming puzzles I really enjoy, though. Â This evening I happened across one such puzzle, viaÂ <a title="@eevee on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/eevee" target="_blank">Eevee&rsquo;s Twitter</a>:Â &#8221;<a title="Reversing the Interview Process - Exodus Intelligence" href="http://blog.exodusintel.com/2012/09/18/reversing-the-interview-process/" target="_blank">implement a strlen() function in C that, when compiled, would not contain any conditional branches</a>.&ldquo; Â (The page contains solutions, so don&rsquo;t read the orange text if you want to try this yourself.) Â This is exactly the kind of puzzle I like; it&rsquo;s fun to think about, reasonably challenging, and requires knowledge of language features combined with creative thinking.</p>

<p>My solution is below, but I&rsquo;d recommend that you go give this a try yourself before you read on.</p>
