Hi, I'm Mitch Lindgren!  I'm a recent Computing Science graduate and Canadian expat working for Microsoft in Redmond, Washington.  This is my personal website, which I use to catalogue my projects and write about topics that catch my attention.  The opinions expressed here are my own and do not represent those of my employer or colleagues.  If you'd like to know more, you can use the links under the Social section on the right to view my profiles on various social networking sites.
